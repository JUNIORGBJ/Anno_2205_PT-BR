105211	"Developing a spaceport will be a great deal of work. Let's call in the professionals."
105387	The year is 2205. Humanity must rely on energy-intensive technology to meet the challenges posed by an environmentally changed home planet. A global energy crisis becomes more and more imminent. The newly developed fusion reactors carry a promise of hope, but require resources only found on the Moon. And so, the world government of the Global Union started the Lunar Licensing Program, allowing corporations to support the government-owned lunar mining colonies with private ones.
105213	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] asks you to provide housing for your construction crew.
105214	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] recommends you to be wary of the competition.
105217	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] reports the arrival of the construction crew.
105220	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] appreciates that you provide organic food for your population.
105441	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is glad your biopolymer production is up and running.
117970	Build [CONDITION_PROFILE_COUNTER_CONTEXT_OBJECT] and connect it to the [GUIDNAME 1000157]
105212	"Your spaceport is furnished with high-end equipment. Skilled operating personnel is a necessity."
105388	The First Wave of Lunar Colonization lies one hundred years in the past. Today lunar mining is overseen by the government-owned Lunar Excavation Corp. Bloated and ineffective, the LEC lost the Global Union's favor long ago and was largely left on their own. Still, it took decades of lobbyism on part of the Big Five to make the Global Union start a new lunar colonization program. Prevailing against these five gargantuan corporations dominating the world market, will require you to invest only the best spaceport technology. And qualified personnel to operate it.
105215	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] points out your space program's demand for skilled ground personnel.
105216	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is convinced your corporation has risen to bigger challenges.
105218	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] welcomes your efforts to secure the water supply.
105221	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] speaks highly of your newly built Infodrome.
105222	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] and her peers boot up the spaceport's control systems.
105398	"A long way to go. Your space elevator will lead directly to the Global Union's orbital headquarters."
105399	The unforeseen Orbital Watch shook the world to its core. One by one, the colonies of the Lunar Excavation Corporation side with the terrorists and suspend their resource deliveries to Earth. The Moon dwellers, who refuse to follow Virgil Drake's crude rhetoric live in danger of oppression. Those who can board shuttles to Earth, but many more don't have this opportunity. Drake's demand to forfeit the Lunar Licensing Program puts the Global Union in a tight spot. But for the sake of all humanity, the program has to go on. And so has the construction of your space elevator.
105413	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] wants you to build a space elevator to the Global Union space station.
105414	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] announces the coming of additional material deliveries.
105219	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] tells you additional materials will be delivered, specifically for the elevator cable.
117873	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] knows a good employer keeps his staff satisfied - like you do.
105440	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] calls on you to proceed with the elevator construction once everything else is ready.
117370	Start the upgrade
105409	"The whole sector was closed off. It seems military intervention is our only option."
105405	Before the Lunar Licensing Program, the mining of Moon resources was the exclusive domain of the Lunar Excavation Corp. But as the Global Union turned its focus away from this organization, the Moon people began to feel neglected and exploited – fertile ground for the ideology of the Orbital Watch, a well-connected terrorist organization of former LEC members. And now, their warships draw a tight circle around the Prycomber strait, blocking the Global Union's most important trade route to sabotage the Lunar Licensing program. Security engineer John Rafferty is determined not to let this happen.
105421	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] urges you to meet John Rafferty at Prycomber Search Area and retrieve the static cable.
105422	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is relieved to see you back in one piece.
105443	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] keeps a stiff upper lip.
105444	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] spotted the location of the beleagured Union cargo ship.
117383	Enter the crisis sector
105438	Free the detained transporters
105410	"Let those lunar terrorists continue their intimidation attempts. The space program is far too important for Earth's people."
105423	Worried about the situation on the Moon, [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] urges you to finish the space elevator.
105406	The unforeseen Orbital Watch shook the world to its core. One by one, the colonies of the Lunar Excavation Corporation side with the terrorists and suspend their resource deliveries to Earth. The Moon dwellers, who refuse to follow Virgil Drake's crude rethoric live in danger of oppression. Those who can board shuttles to Earth, but many more don't have this opportunity. Drake's demand to forfeit the Lunar Licensing Program puts the Global Union in a tight spot, but for the sake of all humanity, it has to go on.
105445	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] wants you to return to the spaceport site.
117371	Finalize the upgrade
105460	"The Arctic holds resources found nowhere else. You should consider a branch there."
105469	The second phase of the Lunar Licensing Program has begun. It points right to the North Pole, the snow-clad hoard of the Earth's last treasures. Protecting the few remaining sources of crude oil and the only ecosystem still bringing forth fish in harvestable quantities, the environmentalist organization called the Arctic Custodians held a stern watch here for almost two centuries. But as things are, the Custodians must share their white paradise with private corporations. They are not happy about this.
105424	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] announces the next phase of the Lunar Licensing Program.
105479	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] had hoped for a friendlier reception.
105478	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] can't wait to assign you arctic territory.
105461	"All formalities have been taken care of. These islands have been approved for settlement by the Arctic Custodians."
105470	Like white diamonds, the icy isles of the Arctic rise up from the sea. Cold, hard and uninviting, they form the territory of the Arctic Custodians. It was them, who developed the climate stabilization technology, enabling them to create a genuine Arctic region in a world battered by the polar melting of the late 21st century. Steadying the global weather, the climate stabilizers exposed settlement areas formerly lost to the sea – at the cost of vast amounts of energy. The Custodians have made clear, they don't want you to interfere with their delicate technology, while you are establishing your first arctic branch office.
105480	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] wants you to erect an Arctic Warehouse on one of these islands.
105481	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] officially confirms your tenures for this settlement zone.
105503	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] encourages you to choose an island of your liking.
105504	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME]  will assign you an island, once you build an Arctic Warehouse there.
117784	Move your Command Ship to a [CONDITION_SOURCE_OBJECT_ASSET]
117372	Claim the island
105462	You'll see, the Arctic landscape will impose very different requirements on your city planning skills.
105471	Over the course of their work, the Arctic Custodians have seen many governments eager to decide the fate of the world. Consequently, many off-hours conferences at the Union headquarters were necessary, until the Arctic Custodians desisted from their prejudices and agreed on opening their secluded territories for the Lunar Licensing Program. Still, Dr. Howard Young, onsite representative of the Custodians, will not tolerate carelessness – and much less if it comes to the standards to be met by private industries on Arctic territory.
105482	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] suggests you establish a small Arctic base.
105483	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] gives permission for spaceport construction.
105505	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] has an eye on both economic and ecological developments.
105506	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] informs you just how rare fish has become.
105507	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] points at the importance of good heat insulation.
120752	Settle your employees close to a heat source
105463	"The Global Union trade routes are still threatened by terrorists. You better establish your own landing place for cargo ships."
105472	Before the opening of the polar regions, Arctic trade was confined to official Arctic Custodian routes, not allowing for much commercial variety on both sides of the trade treaties. With the Global Union routes under constant siege by the Orbital Watch however, the Arctic seaways are increasingly being called for. And while mighty icebreakers set forth to crack safe, new ways through the brash ice, the Global Union plans to link the Arctic economy closer to the world market – via landing places for cargo ships and a space elevator.
105484	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] recommends the expansion of your Arctic spaceport via a pier.
105485	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] asks you for help.
105508	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] deems the head count of employees enough to proceed.
105464	"If they aim at it, they can use the Climate Stabilizers to cause a second climate catastrophe! We must act!"
105473	In 2085, in the aftermath of the disastrous prototyping of geothermal power plants in the Ebashi Trench, global weather drifted to the extremes. Subsequently, the researchers of the environmentalist group called the Eden Initiative founded the Arctic Custodians and developed climate stabilization technology, creating an artificial Arctic zone. And now, 120 years later, Earth faces a new climate catastrophe: The terrorist Orbital Watch assumed control of the Climate Stabilizers. They want to watch the world burn.
105486	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] urges you to help the Arctic Custodians reclaim control of the Climate Stabilizers.
105487	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is glad to tell you the main Climate Stabilizers have been recovered.
117364	Achieve victory in the crisis sector "[GUIDNAME 5100031]"
119711	Reach the next corporation level to enact a counter-hacking attempt
119726	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is curious about the outcome.
119727	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] informs you that your help was received.
105465	"The work at the piers is almost done. Make sure to finish them so your Arctic cargo ships can head for sunnier climates."
105474	The Arctic climate might be returning to colder temperatures again, but the frigid relations between the Global Union and the Arctic Custodians are slowly thawing. The Orbital Watch has proven that it is game for anything and commands the firepower to back their demands up. Only cooperation and determination prevented Earth from slipping into a new climatic disaster. The Arctic Custodians are willing to support the Lunar Licensing Program fully now, green-lighting the expansion of your spaceport.
105488	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] requests you to take your Arctic shipping docks into operation.
105489	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] deems your pursuit for the Moon even more important than before.
115485	"Your aerospace technology has to adhere to the Program's standards. Make sure to have enough shrewd heads at the task."
115486	The Lunar Licensing Program applies high standards to the space technology deployed in it. While past colonizations of the Moon have been successful, relying on old machinery to propel the Second Wave would not be met with the Union's approval – the program is a fresh start into space and any resemblances with the ancient tech of the LEC are to be avoided by its partners. Even if that means great research efforts.
118026	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] requests you to establish a research team.
118027	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] greenlights the implementation of the shuttle blueprints.
118029	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is full of praise for your neuro implant production.
118028	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] approves of your vitamin drink supply.
118030	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] knows that a strong community is important these days.
115487	Conceiving new ways of space travel formerly thought impossible, your aerospace engineers have developed more than ambitious blueprints for shuttles and launch pads. As a proof of their newly found confidence in the Lunar Licensing Program, the Arctic Custodians loosened the export restrictions for greater amounts of mineral resources. Time will tell, if the Big Five jump at this opportunity.
115488	"The metals mined in the Arctic region are perfectly suited for space technology."
118038	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] states that you need specific steels to construct the colony shuttles from.
118039	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] approves of the superalloys.
118044	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is sure these alloys will come in use outside shuttle construction, too.
105466	"Be assured, the command personnel of the Program will have more sophisticated needs than your common worker."
105475	Through bold, persistent lobbyism, the Big Five achieved privileged participation rights for the Lunar Licensing Program before it even started. Yet Orbital Affairs Secretary Samantha Beaumont mobilized the forces of her party to bring you into the program as well, an underdog, acting as a counterpoise to the long-established MegaCorps. Her plan proves to be successful so far: Your corporation is growing relentlessly. But even the most well-organized CEO can't take care of everything at once.
105490	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] wants you to shift responsibilities to executives.
105491	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is looking forward to Phase 2 being completed.
105510	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] underlines how important neuro tech is for the program.
105511	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] sees a great deal of potential in your medical products.
105512	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] relies on rigorous security controls when dealing with terrorism.
105467	"No launch pad, no rocket launch. An ambitious building project lies ahead of you."
105476	The Global Union's Ministry of Orbital Affairs, responsible for overseeing the lunar territories and orbital routes, has only been a small department of the Global Union governing body – and a less than prestigious one, at that, if one looks at the hapless LEC it was in charge of. The Lunar Licensing Program changed that. Now the Ministry of Orbital Affairs connects the world and you are preparing for the big leap to the Moon. To provide for the necessary momentum, a launching pad be installed at your spaceport. To coordinate the construction teams, you have to consolidate your corporation's management level.
105492	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] asks you to support John Rafferty with the launch pad construction.
105493	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is starting with the launch pad construction.
105515	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is happy to see all processes are tightly organized.
116567	"The launch pad construction is well underway. Please arrange for the necessary rare materials."
116568	Steel beam per steel beam, the shuttle launching pads are growing towards the sky, the work of countless busy hands. Lunar Licensing Program supervisor Samantha Beaumont brought in the old gearhead John Rafferty to coordinate the efforts. His presence in the Lunar Licensing Program has led to controversies in the Ministry of Orbital Affairs, especially among the sympathizers of the Big Five. On the quiet, words like "infringement" and "prison term" are voiced, but Rafferty doesn't seem to mind. He much rather sees after the completion launch pad for the Second Wave.
118040	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] gives a forecast of what has to be done next.
118041	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is proud to present a finished shuttle launching pad.
117379	Achieve victory in a crisis sector
117378	Complete optional assignments
105468	"The big moment has arrived. So many people, all burning to see those shuttles fly..."
105477	The colony shuttles are ready for take-off, crewed with brave women and men, leaving behind their easy, earthly life for the unfathomable universe. Last-minute tests are conducted, while the rocket propellant tanks are attached to the bottom of the shuttles. All over the globe, people lay down their tools and set eyes on the big and small screens broadcasting this happening. With bated breath, they are awaiting the countdown of the Second Wave of lunar colonisation.
105494	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] can hardly wait for the colony shuttles to lift off.
105495	Following the rocket with her gaze, [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] announces the start of Phase 3.
105542	"Your colony shuttles are heading for the lunar orbit. They're awaiting orders where to touch down."
105543	The pioneers of the Second Wave set forth for the Moon's grey, alien landscape. It is a voyage into the unknown. Frontier spirit and sense of adventure, that made the colonists leave the familiar atmosphere of Earth behind, blends with anxiety about the terroristic Orbital Watch. It had been some time since the Global Union space station last received news from the LEC And Virgil Drakes will not take a new colony on the Moon lightly.
105634	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is eager to present you lunar settlement zones to choose from.
105635	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] signs over a high quality plot of lunar land.
105544	"A good spot for a lunar colony, if you ask me. And it's all yours."
105549	Hills and valleys covered in dead, gray dust are stretching to the black, starlit horizon. But even in an environment as hostile as the Moon, humanity has a chance to thrive, as hundred years of continued lunar settlement show. In the LEC colonies, whole generations of people have lived and died. Your colonists may not be the first to leave their footprint on the Moon. But they are here. And maybe they can set things right, once they are given a basic supply framework and a place to call home.
105636	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] informs you that moon colonies may only be established in craters.
105637	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] thinks you are ready for the next step.
105646	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is threatening you openly.
105647	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is willing to start work right away.
105648	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] stresses the critical importance of good oxygen supply.
105649	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] explains what materials are needed to build space structures.
118254	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] shows you how vulnerable your colony would be without shield generators.
105545	"Solid interorbital trade routes are the key, if you want your corporation to replace the LEC as lunar resource supplier.”
105550	The Lunar Excavation Corp did not always possess exclusive rights to mine and distribute lunar resources. Before their foundation by the Global Union, private corporations have conducted an armed war over the territories and resources Earth's satellite had to offer. The event entered the history ebooks as the "Eclipse." After a long peace, the Orbital Watch is more than willing to turn the Moon into a battlefield again. Breasting them will not be possible without steady support from Earth and direct orbital transportation routes.
105638	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] informs you about the logistical demands your spaceport will have to meet.
105639	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] lets you in on what has been done for the LEC fugitives coming to Earth so far.
105650	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is impressed by how many people are flocking to your Moon colony.
115941	"Neither the LEC fugitives, nor their Arctic Custodians guardians have the means to brave Drake. You however..."
115942	In the aftermath of the Orbital Watch’s advent to power, moon dwellers opposing the movement’s radical ideology faced oppression and persecution. Those who could secretly fled to Earth with cargo shuttles. The Global Union, overwhelmed by the sheer number of fugitives, used their newly-established diplomatic relations with the Arctic Custodians to set up a provisional reception camp in the Arctic. But the Orbital Watch is without mercy if it comes to dealing with "traitors"...
118257	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] appeals to you to help the LEC fugitives.
118258	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] thanks you profoundly.
117365	Achieve victory in the crisis sector "[GUIDNAME 5100395]"
118261	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] speculates that Virgil Drake maintains his own military facilities on Earth.
118263	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] informs you your economical support enabled the Arctic Custodians to help the fugitives.
119712	Reach the next corporation level to implement supporting measures
115939	"The next stages of the Lunar Licensing Program require a well-running interorbital logistics system."
115940	Extensive measures to repair Earth’s biosphere and unrestrained technological growth have brought the world to the brink of an energy crisis. The ultimate goal of the Lunar Licensing Program is to fend off this scenario by putting a fusion energy reactor into operation. But scientist also see other possible applications of fusion energy. As propellant for rocket drives it might one day enable mankind to travel even greater distances in space – if the fusion reactors work as well as everyone hoped. It will be seen, once their construction is completed.
118264	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] lauds you for your continuing opposition to the Orbital Watch.
118265	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] tells you you can now transport goods to and from Moon.
105685	Striking at the weak spots of their opponents, the Orbital Watch tries to sabotage the Lunar Licensing Program. So far, their terroristic assaults have not brought the program to a standstill. But the newly founded lunar colonies, as dependent on Earth as they are, are easy targets. And before even the slightest efforts in fusion reactor construction can be dared, the Second Wave colonists must be enabled to provide for themselves.
105677	"Dependence on deliveries from Earth makes it easy for Drake. Make your colony more autarkic."
105696	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] wants you increase the self-sufficiency of your colony.
105697	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is satisfied with what measures you have taken.
118266	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is glad, you are offering your colonists medication against cosmic radiation.
118267	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] notes you have found a way to counter the effects of zero gravity.
118268	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] finds a poetical expression to hint at the importance of Maintenance Stations.
118271	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is obviously relieved you provide your colonist more substantial food.
105680	"Fusion energy is our best hope to meet humanity’s increasing energy demands."
105688	Extensive measures to repair Earth's biosphere and unrestrained technological growth have brought the world to the brink of an energy crisis. The ultimate goal of the Lunar Licensing Program is to fend off this scenario by putting a fusion energy reactor into operation. But scientist also see other possible applications of fusion energy. As propellant for rocket drives it might one day enable mankind to travel even greater distances in space – if the fusion reactors work as well as everyone hoped.
105702	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] deems you more than able to implement a fusion reactor building project.
105703	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is excited to see the fusion energy reactor is performing flawlessly.
118346	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] knows, that deuterium is one of the core components of fusion energy generation.
118347	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is glad to see the deuterium transfers to the Moon have been taken care of.
118348	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] tells you that helium-3 is the basic element in fusion energy generation.
118349	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] simmers in expectation of the conclusion of the fusion energy project.
105681	"Modern technology allows for the wireless transfer of energy. Sending it down from space, that's a first though."
105689	A technological marvel in its own right, the newly built fusion reactor merges helium-3 and deuterium, generating clean energy. To share its output with the energy-hungry metropolises on Earth, the Global Union banks on electromagnetical transmission technology, which is already used widely on Earth. However, constructing an energy transmitter able to send microwaves over vast distances will be a challenge – the last and greatest challenge of the Lunar Licensing Program.
105704	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] incites you to conclude the Lunar Licensing Program by building energy transmitters.
105705	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] brings Virgil Drake's secret Earth base to your attention.
119674	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] threatens you as you still pursue the Lunar Licensing Program.
118357	"Weapon research? If Drake thinks he can do this right under the Global Union's nose, he is mistaken!"
118358	The energy crisis is averted! For a few precious days the excitement of Earth’s and Luna’s citizens knew no limits. Robot parades and zero-gravity celebrations were held, the festival halls illuminated with holographic light shows powered by fusion energy. The Lunar Licensing Program might not have ended all of humanity’s problems, let alone the threat by the Orbital Watch, but it brightened the prospects for the future. Your cooperation made all this possible – it is only fitting, that you create a monument for yourself.
118361	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] asks you to get her access to the Orbital Watch research servers.
118362	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] praises you for your great victory against Drake.
118367	Achieve victory in the crisis sector "[GUIDNAME 5100393]"
118365	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is impressed with your stealth abilities.
118366	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] has gained access to the Orbital Watch servers, already wrecking havoc.
119713	Reach the next corporation level to tap the Orbital Watch's secret servers
118359	"All that remains to do is bring the energy transmitters online. I'm counting on you."
118360	The Lunar Licensing Program is nearing its conclusion. What once has been nothing but a distant dream of the future is about to become reality. Humanity’s greatest hopes are pinned on fusion energy as the engine driving a better tomorrow. The final test runs of the energy transmitters will show, if these hopes can ultimately be fulfilled.
118363	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] wants you to transfer fusion energy from the Moon down to Earth.
118364	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] sounds an eulogy on your achievements.
117367	"A powerful corporation like yours needs an adequate headquarter. I'm sure you agree."
117366	The energy crisis is averted! For a few precious days the excitement of Earth’s and Luna’s citizens knew no limits. Robot parades and zero-gravity celebrations were held, the festival halls illuminated with holographic light shows powered by fusion energy. The Lunar Licensing Program might not have ended all of humanity’s problems, let alone the threat by the Orbital Watch, but it brightened the prospects for the future. And your cooperation made all this possible.
118350	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] tells you that you were granted permission to build a prestigeous corporate headquarter.
118351	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] hasn't the slightest doubt you are on eye level with the Big Five.
117368	"Feel free to expand your headquarter if you like. You have the Union's approval."
117369	The Big Five are history. Once they were the unassailable potentates of the global economy. But a new star has risen, exclusive business partner of the Global Union and prizewinner of the race to the Moon. Your corporation’s headquarter alone outshines the former Big Five’s offices. And it is only a matter of time, until you will be called to put other projects into practice – projects, that will push humanity forward again, in this new age of space travel.
118352	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] believes you will expand your headquarter further, given the chance.
118353	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] considers herself fortunate having worked with you.
120671	Build any Corporation HQ module
120450	Your long-term goal is to gain and sustain as many employees as possible. Get employees by constructing residences.
120451	Employees are your main source of revenue. They also provide you with workforce to operate your factories.
120452	Keep constructing residences and increase your employee count to unlock new building blueprints and level up your corporation.
120454	Your employees demand a steady supply of goods to generate workforce. Provide these by building factories from the construction menu.
120455	Some factories like mines or farms generate goods out of natural resources from their environment.
120456	More sophisticated goods are often made from several different materials deriving from longer production chains.
120457	Operating factories takes a toll on your revenue. They also require a supply of workforce, energy and logistics to stay productive.
120458	You gain those by constructing power plants and transportation centers, which have their own maintenance costs.
120459	Balancing the earnings and expenses of your ever-growing economy is the main challenge of "Anno 2205."
120460	Your corporation owns a small contingent of military ships. In a crisis, you take control of this fleet.
120461	Reflecting your economic power, you expand your fleet by more ships and ship types as your corporation level rises.
120462	Crisis sectors are self-contained war zones you can leave and return to at any time, as long as no other sector was loaded.
120463	Completing a crisis sector increases your military level, which allows you to upgrade your ships.
120489	You also gain rare materials in crisis sectors, which are needed to upgrade your spaceport and expand your factories with modules.
120515	Any ships lost during a crisis will be replaced afterwards without incurring additional costs.
120464	Through the Lunar Licensing Program, you receive the first sector of every region for free.
120490	You appropriate additional sectors by buying them off a rival Big Five corporation after you surpassed their corporation level.
120516	Look out for unique sector projects. By completing these, you gain access to permanent benefits.
120465	Claim more construction areas in your sectors by establishing warehouses with your command ship.
120491	Each warehouse generates a small amount of revenue, workforce and energy.
120517	In temperate sectors, expand your already claimed areas by connecting islands via bridges.
120466	Your production facilities give off warmth to heat your settlement. Put your residences near factories.
120492	Arctic settlements tend to be naturally smaller than those in the temperate region and cluster around factories.
120518	You can speed up the settlement construction by buying construction materials from traders.
120467	Modules increase productivity and reduce maintenance costs of your factories, while making them more space-efficient. They require rare materials to be built.
120493	Acquire rare materials by completing assignments or achieve victory on missions in crisis sectors.
120519	You are also awarded rare materials as you reach a new corporation level.
120468	You can take a pacifist approach of opposing the Orbital Watch by improving your economy and gathering more employees.
120494	Optimize your economic balance with small industrial modules that reduce maintenance costs.
120520	The Council on the space station can be a source of rare materials and especially effective modules.
120469	Clients offering assignments can be found at the trading center in every sector.
120495	Traders sometimes offer a small amount of rare materials – for a not-so-small price.
120521	Check your building layouts for optimal efficiency and use modules to fill empty spots.
120470	As your settlements grow, so will the demands of your employees. Some can only be met by goods from other regions.
120496	While playing, you will create many transfer routes on the strategy map, slowly weaving a global logistics network.
120522	A sectors' spaceport level determines which kinds of transfer routes can go in and out. You need a launch pad for Moon routes.
120471	You can use the goods filter on the strategy map to view the exact production balance of a good in your sectors.
120497	Maintaining transfer routes reduces your credit balance depending on the transporter size. Watch your revenue.
120523	Increase your corporation level to get access to larger and potentially more cost-efficient transporters.
120472	Create a transfer route to the space station to sell your overproduction on the world market. You can also buy goods there at the current value.
120498	Market values of goods are influenced by all "Anno 2205" players who trade on the world market.
120524	Sell goods whose selling price is much higher than their production price. Spot such goods by using the goods filter on the strategy map.
120473	Avoid rampant overproduction. Positive good balances are nice to look at, but they can ruin your credit balance.
120499	Only a certain percentage of employees of every level can be promoted. To have Executives, you need a stable foundation of Workers and Operators.
120525	Build up a vast amount of residences in order to promote more people to the top.
120474	Completing assignments for other corporations is a peaceful way to acquire lots of rare materials.
120500	You gain Graphene in temperate crisis sectors and Petrochemicals in the Arctic.
120526	Demolishing already built modules will refund all rare materials used in their construction.
120475	Even sectors dedicated entirely to production require local employees to provide the workforce.
120501	Assignments and corporation levels always take the total number of employees across all sectors into account.
120527	Your command ship is equipped with an universal drone control unit that allows it to operate all assigned drone types.
120476	Download the "Anno 2205 – Asteroid Miner" app for your mobile device and connect it to your account.
120502	Use the app to mine for rare materials in the asteroid belt and send them over to be used by your corporation.
120528	You can also gain rare materials as an Ubisoft Club Reward ([GUIDNAME 999021] - [GUIDNAME 999005]), and collect them at the space station.
120477	With factories that require mountain or coastal building sites, it's usually cheaper to upgrade them than to spread them out too far. Especially on the Moon.
120503	The lunar warehouse provides an initial shielded area to build in. Shield generators can be placed everywhere, but have maintenance costs.
120529	Moon colonies take some time to become profitable. Attempt lunar colonization not until your coffers are well-filled.
120478	Transportation centers and public buildings are expensive. Place them close to factories and residences to use them efficiently.
120504	Supply buildings add to a collective balance only applying to one island. All other buildings on this island satisfy their demands from that balance.
120530	The greater the distance of a building to a source of logistics or public services, the more supply is consumed by it.
120479	You can store only a limited number of special actions in crisis sectors. Use them regularly.
120505	Move your ships tactically to get damaged ships out of the line of fire or lure enemies into minefields.
120531	Caution is a viable tactic. Try to remain out of reach of enemy turrets.
120480	Crisis sectors offer three difficulty levels, with the harder ones rewarding far more rare materials.
120506	Increasing your military level by achieving victory in crisis sectors grants you access to higher difficulties for all such sectors.
120532	All rare materials can be acquired in all crisis sectors, but the materials rewarded for completing a mission there depend on the region.
120481	You can supply your sectors with goods bought on the world market, if you can afford it.
120507	You can only set up a limited number of transfer routes to the space station, used for buying and selling alike.
120533	Level up your corporation to get access to larger and more cost-efficient transporters and increase the maximum number of space station routes.
120482	To get goods from the Arctic to the Moon you have to upgrade your Arctic spaceport with a launch pad.
120508	Alternatively, you can reroute the goods via a launch pad in the temperate region.
120534	You could also send goods to the Moon directly from the world market. Just be wary of other players driving up the prices.
120483	The corporations electable in The Council reduce construction costs and trade prices for certain industries, depending on their relative votes.
120509	A quick way to gain rare materials is to accept the Mysterious Woman's bribe for your vote in the Council.
120535	Her bribe will increase whenever you vote for someone she didn't recommend. How long can you resist her offers?
120484	The gaps between corporation levels increase with every step. There is no limit to how high you can rise.
120510	Think carefully about where to place your buildings and how to use special building sites. There is only so much construction area.
120536	Make good use of modules, since they affect the product output and maintenance costs of your factories tremendously.
120485	You can pause the production in factories if you want to reduce the maintenance costs for a while.
120511	A spaceport equipped with an energy transmitter is required in every sector you want to transfer energy to.
120537	Energy is shared across connected sectors, with a deficit affecting all sectors equally.
120486	The corporation headquarter has very high maintenance cost. Show everyone that you can afford it.
120512	Beautify your cities with ornaments like fountains or parks of all sizes.
120538	Unlock additional ornaments in the Ubisoft Club. You can also get wallpapers, logos or a new HQ skin there.
120487	Try to complete all sector projects to gain permanent benefits and achievements.
120513	As a long-term goal, aim for one million employees. You will need many sectors and transfer routes to reach that goal.
120539	Play again on a higher difficulty. Or adjust the game to your liking with the advanced settings.

114709	An A.I. voice sounds within the Ark.
114702	"I'm trying to wheedle a recovery team out of my superiors. Stay tuned."
114710	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] asks you to be patient until she receives her superiors' support.
114711	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] believes she might now be able to boot up the Ark's systems.
114703	"It will take some time to analyze the Ark's condition. I'll give you a shout."

118180	"Okay, let's start off with some fundamental research. We have to know exactly what kind of facility we're dealing with."
118181	"Woah, what a find! It's an Ark, an old floating research station! We should prepare for a diving expedition to examine it further."
118182	"Okay, should be sufficient living space for the team. Next we'll need capable divers. But you're the expert in staff acquisition, I guess."
118183	"Um... yeah, details... I've kinda underestimated the supply expenses. Say, could you take care of provisions?"
118184	"Divers submerging... once I get this error out of the lazer cutters. Sure, we could fall back on dull old drills. But you supply the materials, then."
118185	"Right, you're not looking for a sec, and someone goes after your research object. Looks like Usoyev's line of work. Don't be squeamish!"
118187	"We better close off the area. This is our scientific discovery! I'm not taking chances it's cannibalized in the name of profit."
118189	"Alright, I've compiled a security plan. I'm counting on you to assemble the onsite security forces. Should keep out any unbidden guests."
118190	"I'll admit it, I can't decode this all on my own. Or disassemble it. I need assistants."
118191	"Now the fun part! I've cooked up this pretty promising design for a hoisting crane. Can't wait to turn it into a steely reality."
118209	"The difficult part is to preserve the original A.I. unit. Better have some androids link up with the Ark servers and act as backup storages, just in case."
118210	"Alright, next step is to supply the Ark with electricity. The onboard accumulators went belly-up, so I hope I may tap your network instead."
118211	"I'm sure we can bring the Ark back to the surface. The propulsion system doesn't looks all that broken. With a few new parts here and there..."
118212	"Nope, the old propulsion engines can't rile up enough buoyant force to keep the Arc afloat by its own. Let's give it artificial legs!"
118213	"No working propulsion engine here. But I'm sure I can tweak some Anti-Grav engines to do the job. C'mon! This is practically failsafe!"
114658	"Okay, let's start off with some fundamental research. We have to know exactly what kind of facility we're dealing with here."
114659	"Woah, what a find! It's an Ark, an old floating research station! We should prepare a diving expedition to examine it further."
114660	"Okay, should be sufficient living space for the team. Next we'll need capable divers. Good you're an expert at hiring staff, huh?"
114661	"Um... yeah, details... I seem to have kind of underestimated the cost of supplies on this project. Say, could you deliver some provisions for the team?"
114662	"Divers in the water... once I get this error out of my SubAqua Breathing Unit. Sure, we could fall back on the plain old air tank, if you insist."
114663	"Right. You look away for one sec and they start dismantling your research object. Looks like Usoyev's kind of thing. Don't be squeamish!"
114664	"We'd better cordon off the area. I don't think I can handle any more unbidden guests stealing our stuff."
114665	"Okay, now for the fun part! I've cooked up this pretty promising design for a crane hoist. Can't wait to turn it into a steely reality. "
114666	"I'm sure we can bring the Ark back to the surface. The propulsion and energy systems are broken, but a few maintenance bots can probably fix that."
114667	"Alright, next step is to supply the Ark with electricity. The onboard accumulators are useless, so I hope I can tap your network instead."
114668	"Um, looks like the old propulsion doesn't provide enough lifting power. But I'm sure I could tweak some Anti-Grav engines to do the job."
109017	"Hey, please, don't kick me out... I'm just pursuing a pet project of mine. Give me a minute and you'll see how worthwhile my research is, okay?"

113223	"The question is: What made the dams collapse back then? We should analyze the debris to find out."
113224	"We have a theory about what destroyed the dam. But we will need more manpower to verify that theory quickly."
113225	"Hmm, Lei Sheng should've tested Global Trust's designs before using them. The analysis says the dams collapsed due to water turbulence caused by subaqua rock formations. We have to minimize this risk in the future."
113226	"Lei Sheng's finance department is considering cancelling dam construction. Not enough demand, they say. Not a business case. Well, let's make it one then. "
113227	"We may now officially start building the dam. Could you see to the delivery of the required materials?"
113229	"This dam may look like it is in better condition, but the remains are far beyond repair. We should get them out of the way."
113230	"The dam building site is difficult to access. I'm curious to see if your logistics system will be up to the task."
113231	"Now all that's missing are a few tons of special steel. Still, I'm confident you will find a way to get them."
113233	"This is crucial! There's evidence that Orbital Watch agents placed underwater explosives near our dams! The clock is ticking!"
113234	"The Orbital Watch incident is making our investors nervous. Some are already withdrawing their funds. But I'm informed you are well prepared..."
113235	"It seems Lei Sheng's finance department is still not convinced. They want to inspect the dams before they allow us to bring them online. Be polite."
118101	"The question is: What made the dams collapse back then? We should analyze the debris to find out."
118102	"We have a theory what destroyed the dam. But to get a clear result quickly, we need more manpower."
118103	"Lei Sheng should've tested Global Trust's designs first. The analysis says the dams collapsed due to turbulences, caused by underwater rock formations. We have to minimize this risk."
118104	"Lei Sheng's finance department considers calling the dam building off. Not enough demand, they say. Not a business case. Well, let's make it one then."
118105	"We may officially start the dam building. Could you see to the delivery of the required materials?"
118106	"This dam may look more intact. But the remains of the old construction are beyond repair. We should get them out of the way."
118107	"The dam building site is quite difficult to access. I'm curious if your logistics system will be up to the requirements."
118108	"A few tons of superalloys are missing to finish the support structure. But according to my sources, you are no one who to allows such things to impede progress ."
118109	"Parts of this dam are dangerous to work on. Make sure the staff uses state-of-the-art building machines. Will be cheaper than the labor court costs."
118110	"Due to safety concerns we're postponing work on the more difficult segments until the necessary machinery arrives. You see to that?"
118111	"This is crucial! There's evidence that Orbital Watch agents placed underwater explosives near our dams! The clock is ticking!"
118112	"We're not leaving anything to chance. A security force is necessary to secure the premises at all times. Our investors must not hear of this."
119891	"So, an open provokation? Absurd! Our firepower can take them out easily. But I want you to make a big show of it, to demonstrate our superiority before our investors."
118113	"I'm finished assembling the security teams. Escorting them personally will reveal your involvement in the project. It's all about PR."
118114	"The Orbital Watch incident still worries our investors. Some are already withdrawing their funds. But I'm informed you are well positioned..."
118117	"Our extensive security measures assuaged our investors. They'll want a good look at the dam, so you have the honor of escorting them. Be polite."
118116	"Hosting an opening celebration on site will top it off. Best we hand-pick the waiting staff and invite a few special guests to mingle with our investors."
118115	"The dam will be finished just in time for the opening celebration. How about a luxurious banquet to cater to our investors while they watch the big reveal?"
108585	"Yes, technically this is unannounced intrusion into your territory. But before you report me, listen to my offer."
113228	Reach a Corporation Level of 10 to start the construction of the second dam.
113232	Reach a Corporation Level of 20 to start the construction of the third dam.
113236	"All stations are running smoothly. I'm not easily impressed, but I will certainly keep an eye on you! It seems you won't let anything stop you from turning your visions into realities!"

114680	"First, let's make some room for the foundation. Blasting those boulders will involve some airborne dirt, but I can't imagine you being afraid of that."
114681	"As any project, this requires reliable funding. I do hope you're up to the task. Your competitors didn't prove quite as determined as you seem to be."
114682	"Time to escort the work force. It didn't escape your populace that this project created countless job opportunities out of nothing."
114683	"I understand that keeping the construction site supplied with materials is quite a drain. You know, your flexibility is the reason we chose you over the Big Five for this endeavor."
114684	"Now that the materials production has wrapped up, all that's left to do is make the delivery. Don't take too long or your competitors might claim the project is a waste of time."
114685	"I was just informed of the foundation's completion. The schedule is tight, but surrounding gardens are essential. Can you choose an assortment from the local flora for the gardeners?"
114686	"The gardens require a dedicated workforce or the project will grind to a halt. It would be pretty ironic if we were to need outside help for our monument, wouldn't it?"
114687	"Marble walkways will provide the finishing touch. Afterwards we can start on the main attraction... Hang on, I'm getting a call from an investor, I have to take this."
114688	"Perfect timing, I just secured backing for our final phase. It's asking a lot, but a monument like this can't be made of anything less than titanium."
114689	"There's a smear campain in motion claiming our monument is just compensating for a, and I quote, "dingy rathole of a city". Prove your metropolis is attractive as ever."
114690	"I've ensured that all of the Big Five representatives are in attendance. Escort the equipment and stun them into silence with a perfectly executed lightshow."
118068	"First, let's make space for the foundation. Blasting those boulders will blow up some dirt, but I can't imagine you'd be afraid of that."
118069	"Like any project this here requires reliable funding. I could pitch in. But the Lunar Licensing project has cut into our finances already, so..."
118070	"Time to escort the workforce here. It didn't escape your populace that this project created a myriad of job opportunities out of nothing."
118071	"I understand that sustaining the construction site with materials is challenging. Then again, your flexibility is the reason we chose you over the Big Five for this endeavor."
118072	"Now that the material production is wrapped up, all that's left to do is delivering. Proceed quickly or the press might decry the project as a time sink."
118073	"So, the foundation is complete. Well, our time plan is tight, but surrounding it with gardens is still essential. Can you choose an assortment of the local flora for the gardeners?"
118074	"Our material cost calculation had to be corrected. Regardless, we won't cut our workers' salary, will we? That would cause quite the scandal."
118075	"Marble walkways will be cherry on the cake. Of course I can take care of the... Ah, hang on, a call from an investor, have to take it. You see to everything, right?"
118076	"The gardens still require a good amount of work. And you're likely not relying on external workforce for your own monument. Would be quite ironic, wouldn't it?"
118077	"The construction is in full swing. To keep up you'll have to bring in more professionals. They flock to us! After all you provide work and reliable pay."
118078	"Perfect timing, I just had a call with our stakeholders about the final phase. They want us to install a new holographic display. The processing power needed is nothing to sneeze at."
118079	"It's asking a lot, but a monument like this one can't be made of anything less than titanium. We're building this for the ages, after all."
118080	"We designed the monument to be as energy-efficient as possible. The last stages of the construction will put a strain on your power lines, however."
118081	"A harbor at the foot of the monument is still missing. How else would guests reach it? We'll be relying on tried-and-true materials for this."
118082	"There's a smear campain in motion. They say, our monument is just compensation for a, and I quote, 'dingy rathole of a city'. Let's prove your metropolis is attractive as ever."
118083	"The unveiling needs to be unforgettable. I ordered fireworks, they just need to be positioned for maximum effect. Then, you can lean back and enjoy."
109042	"Good day to you. Work has started on a project that will lead the way for generations to come. Will you rise to the occasion?"
115235	Reach Corporation Level of 10 to continue the construction process.
115236	Reach Corporation Level of 20 to continue the construction process.

114716	"Okay, the crazy stuff... We should gather some data on some of the strange climate anomalies here. Might tell us just what's wrong with the Stabilizer."
114717	"Oh, didn't I say? The other Custodians don't want me to use their labs. It's a bummer, but we'll have to build up our own research team for data analysis."
114718	"So weird. Our researchers can't make head or tail of the anomalies. Good thing some of my buds are climatology experts. I called them in!"
114719	"The experts want to gather some data out at the Stabilizer. Our job is to keep electromagnetical disturbances to a minimum. You might have to switch the lights off."
114720	"Alright, the experts say it's the Troposphere Regulator in the Stabilizer core. Hmm, I've always been told biopolymer tech like that was oh so durable."
114721	"Yeah, I screwed up... The Troposphere Regulator wasn't exactly broken. More like sabotaged. And on top of that, some tampered construction bot stole it! Hope we can track it somehow."
114722	"That robot has been commanded to destroy itself once it drops the stolen part somewhere. We're gonna need a whole lot of computing power to reconstruct its database, man."
114723	"We've reconstructed our jacker-bots memory. Looks like Orbital Watch work. At least we have the position of the Troposphere Regulator. Grab it before they do."
114724	"Fool me twice, shame on me! The Orbital Watch must think they can just fly their spy drones over without us noticing. Let's bring them back down to Earth."
114725	"Been thinking. As long we work on-site, we're sitting ducks for Orbital Watch's sabotage. Why not move the repair work to some secret, off-site locations?"
114726	"Nice one, man! The Troposphere Regulator has been completely repaired. All we gotta do now is install it. Let's go!"
118237	"Okay, the crazy stuff... We should gather some data on the strange climate anomalies here. Might tell us just what's wrong with the Stabilizer."
118238	"Oh, didn't I say? Well, the other Custodians don't want me to use their labs. We'll have to build up our own research team to analyse the data."
118239	"Hmmm, our researchers can't make head or tail of the anomalies. Good some of my pals are climatology experts. I called them in!"
118240	"The experts perform measurements at the Stabilizer. Said we, need to keep electromagnetical fluctations down or something. Whatever, keep the energy supply up."
118241	"Alright, the experts say the Troposphere Regulator in the Stabilizer core is broken. Hmm, I've always been told biopolymer tech was oh so long-lasting."
118242	"Yeah, I screwed up... The Troposphere Regulator wasn't exactly broken. More like sabotaged. And on top of that, some hacked construction bot stole it!"
118243	"That robot was programmed to destroy itself, after dropping the theft somewhere. Will take us a lot of computing power to reconstruct its database."
118244	"Reconstructed the jacker-bots memory. Looks like Orbital Watch's work. But we have the position of the Troposphere Regulator. Seize it before they do."
118245	"Regulator's cut and dry and the crew's working hard on it. Could really do with some proper equipment. We Custodians don't really have the snazziest tech."
118246	"Oh no, this is even worse than we thought! The regulator's cooling system has been turned into swiss cheese, basically. We'll need materials to fix it."
118247	"Fool me twice, shame on me! The Orbital Watch must be thinking they can just send spying drones without us noticing. Let's get them down to Earth."
118248	"I've been thinking. As long we work on-site, we're on show for Orbital Watch's sabotage. Why not move the repair work to secret, off-site locations?"
118249	"It's freezing out here, but the team's having one overheating incident after another... Don't ask me, I'm no scientist! Anyway, they need coolants."
118250	"Wow, the repairs are practically burning through our power lines. I'm told it's almost done and we just need a few more sparks to get through the final steps!"
118251	"Nice going! The Troposphere Controlling Unit was completely rebuilt. All we gotta do is install it."
109043	"Yo, this area's Custodians only. I may not... ah, stuff those stupid rules! We're in big trouble here. Got a minute?"
114920	"Pretty cold out here now, huh? That's how you know our Stabilizer is running smoothly."
114953	"Nice weather, huh? What's that old saying? Make profit while the sun shines. Something like that, anyway."
114954	"Sorry, man, but as long as it's pouring cats and dogs out there, I'm staying in here."
114955	"Uh uh, no way, man... I hate thunder."

114944	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] knows the Arctic Custodians aren't gentle to polluters and put a stop to oil production.
114945	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME]'s mother company offered the Arctic Custodians to take care of the abandoned oil rigs.

114728	"Now, time to dismantle the oil rig. Keep your team size within the limits specified by the Arctic Custodians, please. I want to prevent any misunderstandings."
114729	"Always ensure your local authorities' compliance. Now we may begin with the demolition. Ship in our technicians."
114730	"I'm staying on-site to keep an eye on everything. Could you ensure a steady flow of materials? There's so much we need to properly... stow away the old parts."
114731	"This requires prompt action. One of our transporters ran aground and lost its load. Take care of the mess, but be discreet. We don't want to fuss people, do we?"
114732	"All these abandoned oil rigs... A terrible environmental safety risk for the area in times like these, what with the Orbital Watch terrorism and everything. We should... check to see how unstable they really are. Just in case."
114733	"You see? Now imagine if the Orbital Watch were to attack this oil rig. We had better gather the materials needed for any eventual repairs. The Arctic Custodians will appreciate it."
114734	"You heard Dr. Young! Let us overhaul the frame before any more... unforeseen problems occur. The safety of this region is very important to me."
114735	"The black gold flows. Slowly. We may only tap small amounts at a time. But if there were an incident which were to force us to pump faster... Something like a broken safety valve..."
114736	"Yes, the oil leakage examination is today! It must have slipped my mind. But you heard the man! Full power! I hope the safety valves can handle the pressure..."
114737	"Well, it's a good thing the Arctic Custodians have competent experts like us on call. Come, let us take care of this... problem."
118218	"The pipelines of this rig are ailling. We cannot allow the oil to simply flow into the ocean, so we should seal the leakages."

118223	"All these abandoned oil rigs... Such a safety risk for the area, with all the moon terrorism nowadays. We should put their stability to the test. Just in case."
118224	"See? Now imagine it had been the Orbital Watch. We better acquire the materials necessary for the eventual repairs. The Arctic Custodians will appreciate it."
118225	"You heard Dr. Young! Let us overhaul the frame before anything happens. We'll need enough fuel for our welders. The safety of this region is very dear to me."
118226	"We can't leave the Arctic Custodians to do all the hard work, this is our responsibility now. So we'll need our own crew for it."
118227	"And now the hands-on repairs! Our expert team is most trustworthy. So don't trouble yourself with the supervision. I'm here too, after all!"
118228	"The black gold flows. Slowly. We may only tap small amounts at a time. But if there were an occurence, forcing us to pump faster. Like broken security valves..."

118230	"Well, good the Arctic Custodians have competent experts like us on call. Come, let us take care of this... problem."
118231	"The rigs are more than the Custodians can handle! But with your settlement nearby we could maintain a crew to monitor the rig. At all times."
118232	"Good news! We're officially responsible for emptying this rig to prevent any further problems. The crew is here, too. Let's start the long-term surveillance."
109044	"I had hoped to meet you here. I know you are unlike other CEOs. You don't shy at making uncomfortable decisions where our environment is concerned. That's why I want to offer you this opportunity. "

114738	"Before we start constructing our first channel, you'll have to examine a few cracks in the ice plain. It won't do to set up the site and find out the layer is impassable."
114739	"Dr. Young's concerns are exaggerated. Let's not get distracted. Construction of the Icebreakers requires a stable supply of materials."
114740	"I'm pleased to report the teams are ready to be brought to the site. They are eager to get this project off the ground. It will bring life to this desolate place."
114741	"You'd think all Custodians would appreciate the economic growth this project brings. Make sure there are enough helping hands."
114742	"I've received reports of fractures in the ice. We'll need to construct a mesh that will stop ice floes from breaking off into the channel. Would you deliver the materials?"
114743	"We have no choice but to detonate an iceberg for our second channel or the ice will be impassable. I'm sending the coordinates."
114744	"Fair enough. Losing the Custodian's support is certainly a setback at such a critical point. But still. Make sure our icebreakers' energy supply is taken care of."
114746	"Respond immediately! A ship has been sunk by a stray floe at the third channel site. The survivors barely made it into the lifeboats, we don't... we don't know how many didn't make it."
114747	"Do you have enough Stimulants? The survivors need strength! I knew the endeavour was risky, but I thought it was worth it. But how can sacrificing lives be worth it?"
114748	"I was too hasty... I should never have forced the shortest way through. No more risks. Make sure the icebreakers are equipped with diamond coating."
117748	"Before we start constructing our first channel, you'll have to examine a few cracks in the ice plain. We want to rule out the layer is impassable."
117749	"Dr. Young's concerns are exaggerated. Let's not get distracted, we need enough scientists to finalize our calculations and prepare teams."
117750	"I'm pleased to report the teams are ready to be brought to the site. They are eager to get this project off the ground, it will bring life to this desolate place."
117751	"A stable energy supply is tricky to establish here. Make sure it doesn't fluctuate during our final calibrations. Oh, didn't I mention we'd be using explosives?"
117752	"Now move the team to a safe distance. And don't worry about the Custodians, this procedure adheres to the strictest of regulations. I will assuage them."
117753	"Fast and effective, my favorite work ethics. The honor of pushing the button is all yours."
117754	"We've been warned about the next location. We've also been warned to secure the protected wildlife. Let's show our goodwill."
117755	"We cannot proceed with stationary explosives, the terrain is too hard to navigate. But why not use what we already have, such as mobile firepower."
117756	"Fair enough. The Custodian's support has been lip service anyhow. Our plan's next step is the construction of a high-pressure ice drill."
117757	"This drill will break through the plain and provide pockets to place the proper detonators. Of course it has to be operated by capable hands."
117758	"The ice is a lot sturdier than expected. Well, perseverance is what separates the wheat from the chaff. Fuel the drill and we'll be through in no time."
117759	"The explosive charges have been placed, but the team still is on site. The evacuation radius is a vague number, but I'm sure all will be well."
117760	"Your work has been outstanding, I'm looking forward to this project's future. And now to the main attraction."
117761	"Respond immediately! An icebreaker sunk trying to break open a channel! The survivors barely made it onto lifeboats, we... we don't know how many didn't."
117762	"We need to bring them to someplace warm! I knew this method was risky, but I thought it was worth it. But how can sacrificing lives be worth it?"
117763	"I was too hasty... I should never have forced the shortest way through. Retrieve the icebreaker parts or the site won't be safe to approach."
117764	"I'm done with risks. I've personally ordered the development of a method that can be easily controlled. And our brightest minds will build it."
117765	"No more brute force. We'll be melting the explosives into the ice. The placement has been calculated thoroughly. Please escort the team to place them."
117766	"Of course it's operation won't come without a high demand in energy. But there'll be no excess heat - only efficient heat."
117768	"The team is finished setting up. They should be brought to a safe distance for an operation of this size. My company will be retrieving the waste later."
117770	"The perimeter has been secured. Just say the word. Or press the button, so to say."
109045	"I expected to see you here. Let me explain my case: Saayman International hopes to expand the arctic's food supply network, in partnership with you."
115263	Reach a Corporation Level of 12 to continue the ice-breaking process.
115264	Reach a Corporation Level of 24 to continue the ice-breaking process.
114922	"These channels are a beacon for trade in the arctic. It's my duty to make certain they stay safe. You helped us in our hour of need, I will not forget that."
120054	Break through a floating glacial sheet to create a new transport route.
114838	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] holds out for more refugees to arive.
114839	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is grateful you helped so many people stay alive, promissing to spread the word.
114840	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is grateful you gave the refugees a safe home and a new perspective.

117862	A desperate [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] approaches you for help.
117863	In her desperation, [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] tells you she and her charges are being hunted by the Orbital Watch.
117864	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] informs you just how life-threatening the situation on former LEC territory is.
117865	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] has no other choice than to ask you to accept refugees in your settlement.
117866	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] has an ear to the ground for any new refugees.
117867	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is expecting more refugees sometime soon.
117868	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] promises the refugees will help out where they can.
120367	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] voices his intent to oppose the refugee camp.
120368	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is enraged, that Virgil Drake has placed landmines all around the camp.
120371	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] thanks you for taking him to the camp.
120369	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is happy to receive new refugees...
120375	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is beside herself, as Orbital Watch spies have poisoned the supplies.
120377	Grudgingly, [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] admits his plan has failed.

114749	"The people flee in whatever vehicles they can muster. Many drive around aimlessly until their oxygen reserves run out. I know some of them made it to this sector. Please, take them in."
114750	"I've sent out a signal on all the unmonitored frequences. More refugees will come. But I doubt their vehicles will make it all the way. If we only had some transporters to pick them up."
114751	"One of my spies at the Orbital Watch HQ put her neck on the line to divert a shuttle. It'll drop dwelling units for the refugees here. She can't risk doing that again, so we have to retrieve them now."
114752	"Oh, heck! Those dwelling units didn't take the drop well... Most are just a pile of junk now. Do you have some spare metal, so we can make them at least habitable?"
114753	"We've settled the refugees in the dwelling units. I have to rely on you for their food supply. Any food will be fine, as long as it's rich and nourishing."
114754	"What... What kind of monster would order something like that done! Virgil Drake... he had the whole area mined! Some refugees have already... No, we won't allow that to happen again!"
114755	"Good thing you cleared the way. There's another refugee convoy approaching this sector. It contains more asylum seekers than I planned for. We'll have to watch our food supplies."
114756	"Orbital Watch scum! They attacked the refugee convoy! The survivors are going to continue on foot. They won't survive long! We have to collect them, quick!"
114757	"Damn that Virgil Drake! The man is evil incarnate! A new refugee convoy just arrived. It's people say Drake's henchmen hunted them like animals! But we can give them sanctuary!"
114758	"Should've smelled them, the rats! There were Orbital Watch agents among the newcomers! They put highly contagious pathogens into our water tanks! We need medical staff on-site, now!"
114759	"Our doctors have made an initial diagnosis! A modified influenza virus, highly contagious. I bet Drake planned on us having no way of getting the needed medication! But we have you."
118272	"The persecutees flee in whatever vehicles they can muster. Many drive around aimlessly, until their oxygen reserves fail them. But some of them made it."
118273	"I've sent a signal on all non-surveilled frequences. More refugees will come. Their vehicles won't carry them all the way here. We must provide transporters."
118274	"One of my spies at an Orbital Watch colony managed to divert a shuttle, dropping dwelling units for the refugees. She can't risk to do that again, so retrieve them now."
118275	"Oh, heck! Those dwelling units didn't take the drop well... Do you have some spare metal, so we can make them habitable again?"
118276	"Everyone's quartered in the dwelling units. I have to rely on you for the food supply, though. Whatever food will be fine, as long as it's rich and nourishing."
118277	"What horrible person would command such a thing! Virgil Drake had the whole area mined! Some refugees already... No, we will not allow that to happen again!"
118278	"Good you've cleared the way. There's another refugee trek approaching this sector, with more people than I calculated for. We'll have to ration our food."
118279	"The oxygen tanks! Orbital Watch rats, they don't even stop at our very basis of existence! And we can't just ration breathing air, too."
118280	"Our growing numbers proof how many people suffer from Drake's atrocities. And they also mean we have more life support systems to power."
118281	"Drake's men do everything to keep the refugees from coming here. Now they use jamming drones, causing the vehicles to break down, leaving the refugees inside for death! Quick!"
118282	"A transmission from a new refugee convoy. They say Drake's henchmen have hunted them like animals! But we can bring them to safety!"
118283	"Should've smelled the rats! There were Orbital Watch agents among the newcomers! They've put toxic agents in our oxygen systems! We need medical staff on-site!"
118284	"Those rats, they are using the chaos to get back to Drake! A buggy was reported missing just now, you can still find them! And then you can leave them to me."
118286	"We won't so careless again, I won't be. Drake and his lickspits stop at nothing. Our people need trained security to protect them!"
118285	"Our doctors have examined the toxins! An unusual chlorine compound, highly reactive. I bet Drake planned for us having no way treat it. But we have you."
109046	"Oh, finally… Listen, we... we just don't know where else to go. Don't send us away! There are lives at stake. We'll repay you, I promise."
114923	"All those people would be dead now, if it wasn't for you. We'll do our best to pay you back! I promise, everyone here will pitch in to help."
115318	Reach Corporation Level of 15 to provide shelter for more refugees.
115319	Reach Corporation Level of 30 to provide shelter for more refugees.

114852	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is awed by the project's success. He'll get back to you.
114853	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] will inform you if the project is to be continued.

116387	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] approaches you about an endeavour.
116388	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] proposes a joint project to extract minerals out of meteors.
116389	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] believes meteoric resources are scientifically and economically important.
116390	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] looks forward to your cooperation in this prestigious venture.
116391	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is currently unavailable, but will contact you.
116392	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is waiting for clearance and asks that you wait.
116393	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is proud of the mining project's significance.
117319	Project stage 1 completed

117326	Mining site at third meteor established
117327	[GUIDNAME 117321]
114760	"Before we proceed to drill into the meteors, we must first determine what exactly we'll be drilling for. Could you perhaps locate some meteor samples for us?"
114761	"You know, technically they're not meteors, but meteoroids since... Oh! Pardon me. You'll have to provide housing for some meteor scientists, who'll analyze our findings."
114762	"The analysis is in! And the minerals in there will have every earth mine turning green with envy. Of course, we'll still have to break open our meteor. I'll leave that to you."
114763	"My superior commends our progress. She's confident this will prove that mining is a long-lasting business. Speaking of which, we'll need titanium to supply our miners with tools."
114764	"Cassian Industries is planning great things at the moment. It would be much appreciated if you'd take care of the delivery without me while I'm in a meeting."
114765	"Can I trust you to keep this confidential? Cassian Industries decided to pursue the idea of a second mine, but we've lost contact with our expedition team. Please, retrieve them!"
114766	"The team is suffering from radiation sickness and my superior is beside herself! If we don't have to transfer the patients, we'd be happy to recompense you for treatment."
114767	"My superior is placating the merge part- I mean, the media. But there's still the aftermath. The expedition came across radioactive waste, please clear it out."
114768	"My proposal for a minimally staffed, automatic mine has been approved! And I was appointed executive in charge. You'll help me escort the drilling equipment, won't you?"
114769	"The drill is still an experimental prototype and it's burning through our energy supply! My superior is not responding, so please help me!"
114770	"I've just received reports of the drill overheating and threatening to malfunction! What do we do now? Do you have anything that could help, anything at all?"
118292	"Before we can drill into the meteors, we'll first have to determine what exactly we'll be drilling for. Could you locate meteor samples for us?"
118293	"You know, technically they're not meteors, but meteoroids since... Oh! Pardon me. You'll have to accomodate meteoritic scientists, who'll analyze our findings."
118294	"The analysis is in! And the minerals in there will have every earth mine go green with envy. Of course, we'll still have to break open our meteor. I leave it to you."
118295	"My superior commends our progress. She's confident this will prove that mining is a long-lasting business. Speaking of which, we'll need titanium for the mining tools."

118298	"The team is suffering from radiation sickness, my superior is beside herself! If we don't have to transfer the patients, we'd be happy to recompense you."
118299	"My superior is placating the merge part... I mean, the media. We'll have to outfit our next team with all they need to brave the radioactive conditions in there."
118300	"A well-paying job with a full coverage insurance. My superior is certain there will be a crowd of aspirants for our second team! But... you could help things along, yes?"
118301	"Weathering this scandal hasn't been easy. The press has jumped at the radioactive waste at the site. Please clear it out thoroughly."
118302	"We barely managed to fill all positions. My superior wants us to go ahead with escorting the new excavation team. I'm sure it will be fine."
118303	"My proposal was approved. A minimally staffed, automatic mine. And... I myself am fully responsible for it. I hope you're still helping me with the drilling equipment?"
118304	"This time we need a crew to remote-control the drill. The risks are much lower this way, and the job is more attractive. I do hope so, at the very least..."
118305	"I've just received reports of the drill overheating and threatening to break down! What do we do now? Do you have anything that could help, anything at all?"
118306	"The drill is still an experimental prototype and it's burning through our energy supply! My superior is not responding. Please, help me this once!"
118307	"I have a proposal. A diamond-coated drill head will reduce the power expenses substantially. I couldn't confirm this with my superior... but it will work! It has to!"
109047	"A pleasure to see you. I have a proposal for you from Cassian Industries: How do you feel about making use of the stuff stars are made of?"
114924	"For a time I feared my superior would be correct about the project being utopian. Instead, I have been given more tasks like these."
115320	Reach Corporation Level of 15 to start the second meteor exploitation.
115321	Reach Corporation Level of 30 to start the third meteor exploitation.
120056	Extract rare materials from meteor impacts on the Moon's surface.
114866	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] thinks it's the right time to lean back and let everything develop.
114867	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is satisfied with the publicity and plans for the next hotel event.
114868	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] withdraws from the project, having gathered all informations she needed.
115328	The [NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] announces the first guests are already on their way.
115329	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is delighted to see things going so well.
115330	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] mentions she might have added vision recorders to the androids' functionalities.
115331	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is happy to see some of his business partners on the guestlist.
120396	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] hopes to secretly discuss business with his partners tonight, in private.

114772	"Our future guests have extraordinary taste. Our service personnel must be able to read their every wish from their eyes... and not only that. Provide me some human resources to work with here, okay?"
114773	"We haven't even opened! And they're already flaming us about the view on the hotel rating plattforms. We better get rid of the old worker barracks at the site."
114774	"Demolishing the worker barracks wasn't enough. Now they're screaming about wanting the 'real lunar life'. Let's just cater to their romantic ideas, okay. Give them a big, authentic lunar city."
114775	"And here they are, our first visitors! Please, give them a fitting reception. And make sure our special guest gets the special treatment."
114776	"Our hotel's ratings are dropping. Our guests are complaining about the lack of unique, extreme experiences. Why not give them a show? Fire them up a little."
114777	"Give them a war and they'll perk up. The adrenaline junkies among our guests are dying to take a tour through the lunar civil war sites. Let's grant them their suicidal little wish. Just provide some bio-enhanced space suits for them."
114778	"The civil war tour is quite popular, but we should've used more reliable vehicles. Some broke down, so we had to drag them back here. All those hours trapped in a steel box. Makes our guests talkative, I'm sure."
114779	"I've planned a big anniversary event. It'll put our hotel on everyone's lips. But to handle that we are gonna have to ramp up our staff with Androids. Any extra hands and eyes are welcome."

114781	"Check! Didn't have all that super-rare meat foodstuff on my radar. I'm not into steak and wine or whatever it's called. But only the best for our guests. Fly the stuff in."

118322	"Now available: Tours through the lunar civil war sites! The adrenaline junkies among our guests will approve. Just provide some bio-enhanced space suits for them."
118323	"We don't have them go to actual warzones of course. Doesn't mean this never was one, though. Just demonstrate what the forgotten landmines around here are capable of."
118324	"Give them a war and the spirits rise, huh? They're almost out for blood now. And we have a substitute. Robots demolishing robots should be an a-ok, ethically. Sort of."
118325	"The civil war tour is quite popular. But it seems our vehicles had a... malfunctioning. All those hours trapped in a steel box. Makes our guests talkative, I'm sure."
118326	"I've planned for a big anniversary event. That'll make our hotel a talking point. Means we gotta ramp up our staff with Androids."

118330	"Let's get to the highlight - a buffet in zero gravity. Don't worry, we won't be paying those laundry bills. But we will be setting a trend, trust me."
118331	"Okay, our glamourized bouncing castle needs more juice than I thought. Having the high-society fall on their backsides would disturb their animated conversations."
109048	"What to do with this old ruin? Well, I have an idea. Of course, no 'satisfaction guaranteed or your money back'! And you'd have to invest a lot before it pays off!"
114925	You may keep all the profits for yourself. I'm totally fine with my role as silent observer.
115322	Reach Corporation Level of 15 to begin the second hotel expansion.
115323	Reach Corporation Level of 30 to begin the third hotel expansion.
120057	Create and supply the biggest tourist attraction in outer space.
108452	"Just one slip of the pen on the form and boom, the suppliers scatter your goods all over the place!"
108453	"Stiffin' ol' Nic on the bills! Bring those bums to me and you can have the... reminder fee."
108454	"Let's just say it's a... special bottle message, with contents very dear to me."
108617	"An early cargo drop! Thought we'd save some time and try a cheaper shipping method."
108462	"The supply firm let me down here. But I know you wouldn't let ol' Nic down!"
108463	"When they asked me about a good, reliable supplier who asks no questions... guess whom I recommended."
108466	"Mutinary! Thankless bunch! But I'm reasonable... Drag them here and we'll talk about raises. My way."
108467	"Has Big Five written all over it! But Nic always delivers! Or his good friends..."
108470	"Thought ol' Nic wouldn't see it coming! The cargo hold is full of... unstable substances. Let's spring the trap!"
108471	"Look, didn't mean no harm, when I told him you're behind the loss. But he seems... displeased."
108474	"So many ships lost to today's violence. Would be a waste, if their packages remained unplunder... err, undelivered."
108475	"Just threw my crates overboard! For some bad checks! Ah, good thing I got me some of those fancy tracking devices."
108456	"It's... it's practically mine. The paperwork is... is just a little behind. Collect it, it'll be fine."
108460	"Release is in a few weeks. But one of my customers is on pins and needles, know what I mean?"
108618	"There're things you just shouldn't steal. Someone's gonna learn that lesson today."
108464	"Sent those goods over and over. Confiscated every time. But with your label on them, maybe… just maybe…"
108465	"I know, the reek... It's... ugh, just make sure it's delivered. The receiver will get the message."
108468	"Why do those Union agents always target my ships. Got nothin' to hide... say, how discreet are you?"
108469	"Not stolen... found it! And found a customer for it! But it seems someone misses it really badly."
108472	"If she blows the whistle, I'd be forced to publish all my business relations. You wouldn't want that."
108473	"Bah, postage free delivery! Let's hope this new start-up isn't caught in a series of... unfortunate events."
121241	"So my clients decided to show up unannounced and in a bad mood. Think you can help getting their stuff to them?"
121243	"The Big Five have been getting awfully competitive lately... Let's intercept some deliveries, they'll be busy blaming each other."
108626	"Really, a trading partner! Came all the way out here! But err... can you pick them up while I prepare the documents?"
108627	"Oh no... seems I lost that shipment! But if I request a retrieval team everyone will know I screwed up!"
108628	"Express delivery. Said I didn't care where they drop off, as long as they do it quickly... well."
108629	"Man, of all things the raiders picked my freighter! The crew got out okay, but we gotta salvage what's left of the cargo."
108630	"Man, the Union cut the supplies for the Arctic Protection Fund again. Could you pitch in just this once?"
108631	"I need to get on this customer's good side. The how-to guides say stuff about free giveaways. Worth a try."
108632	"Oops, that transporter should've made it here. That's what the Custodians get for being so damn stingy about everything."
108633	"A distress signal! Yeah, it comes from a poacher ship. But, we can't just leave those people strained, right?"
108634	"I'm not a friend of violence, but the Custodian orders are. No raider ships allowed here. Say, could you..."
108635	"Yo, I'm not making that up! There's a whole fleet of them in this sector! And still, no one believes me!"
108636	"I'm supposed to check on a data cache for Dr. Meticulous, but I don't even know where to start!"
108637	"My fellow Custodians said it's way important. Only someone reliable like I could do it. But I need help."
108638	"Wanted to install some anti-theft trackers, but the raiders beat us to the punch. In all senses of the word."
108639	"A fellow roped me into testing his new detection system. Got loads to do, but how could I say no?"
108640	"Nah, only heard good things about this trader. He forgot to provide some info in the papers, but that can happen to anybody."
108641	"Having them owe us is definitely gonna pay off for the Custodians, and boy do we need that."
108642	"I told him not to go. Now a friend of mine is stuck in hostile waters. I'd appreciate if you kept this to yourself, 'kay?"
108643	"Yo, those polluters, they've directly run into our trap. Why won't the Big Five leave us in peace?"
108644	"Why isn't the Global Union doing anything about these pirate threats? Sometimes I wonder if they've forgotten about us."
108645	"No kiddin', fellow Custodians doing business with poachers! Know where they are, but you have to keep a low profile."
121244	"You got a minute? I'm kind of stressing out about these deliveries, I just can't figure out how to organize this!"
121245	"The poaching is getting out of hand! I just can't catch those bastards, they've got surveillance and keep switching locations."
108647	"One of our agents needs a get-away, stat. Can I trust you with her safety?"
108648	"My contacts dropped off some supplies. They couldn't risk sending the coordinates, but we've got the general area."
108649	"Had to abandon medicine supplies to get away from Orbital Watch hellhounds. But, I need those here, asap!"
108650	"I've discovered a great place to restock. Had nearby agents dig up LEC caches, but they still need to be picked up."
108651	"More refugees just arrived and we're missing basically everything. A small donation would be great."
108652	"My Orbital Watch contact must replace the shipment she has sent us or she's in deep shit. We're not letting her down, right?"
108654	"One of our rovers is acting up again. If you get it here somehow, we'll fix it on our own."
108655	"Damn, their life support systems! No time to lose! We have to get to this fugitive rover now!"
108656	"An intact, abandoned vehicle? There? Clearly a Orbital Watch trap, I'm not falling for."
108657	"I need a good diversion. It's still a risk, but for their route plans I'm willing to take it."
108658	"A lot of my trading goods come from abandoned First Wave facilities. We can't afford to be picky. Keep your eyes open!"
108659	"We're safe to collect the caches now. After I jammed the mine field Drake had put up there. Barbaric."
108660	"The Orbital Watch stumbled over one of my old hideouts. Get the stuff back before they realize what exactly they found."
108661	"Yeah, go ahead, grab more of that! Orbital Watch, taking from those who have nothing left."
108662	"Shit, surveillance drones! But my smugglers risked a lot to get here, we're not blowing this off now."
108663	"Good, the supply delivery made it here. But one thoughtless move and the Watch got us. Counting on you."
108664	"Our convoy drove right into an Orbital Watch trap. We're lucky no one was injured, so please make sure it stays that way."
108665	"They captured them just before they reached the border. Get them out, before Drake gets to interrogating them."
108666	"This operative has stopped responding long ago. Well, now we know why."
108667	"Observers! Take them out before they can call for backup. These people really believe in Drake, even after all he's done..."

121246	"I've stuffed a few dead vehicles full of supplies. Can you tow them to passing refugees? They've got no time for detours."
121247	"The Watch set up obvious baits, fully-stocked stranded vehicles. Can you get them for us without setting them off?"
108681	"Sent one of me lads out to look for my last prototype. The dimwit ended up getting lost!"
108682	"My delivery drone had... uh... kind of a quarrel with its cargo. Now the stuff's all over the darn place."
108685	"Hah, quality product! That mine dismantler simply got blown to smithereens. Gonna build something better from the scraps."
108686	"Meant to sent one of those slackers to pick it up. And suddenly they're all off, pretending to be busy."
108687	"I've put it on that order list, but I need it now. Can't wait for them paper pushers to finish their coffee!"
108688	"I cut my ties with the Big Five a long time ago, but some of their underlings are decent. At least for business."
108689	"Crunch your numbers and that, but nothin' beats a hands-on test drive. And if it's just to see if you made bags of it."
108690	"One of my engineers cooked up a darn good ship fuel. Ate right through the tanks. Now she needs a lift!"
108691	"This ship's been with me for donkey's years. Can't do a thing about her defects. A proper burial, how's that sound?"
108692	"Them thick bastards showed up trying to get my blueprints! Give them hell, I say!"
108693	"Ever heard of time capsules and geocaching and that? Could use a hand, but don't you dare tell my crew about it!"
108694	"Leave that dossers on their own just one second, and the next your drones are doing nosedives."
108695	"Forgot a couple of parts out there. And what you say, the Big Five already have their greedy hands on them."
108696	"Don't tell the Beaumont girl. Some parts are just tricky to come by, for... rule-oriented people."
108697	"Long story. Just tieing up loose ends here. Don't be a stickler and help me with it, eh?"
108698	"Some sensitive weapon plans we got here. The Union's got tight security regulations for delivery."
108699	"Such a beauty. Can't leave her at the whim of those ne'er-do-wells. Hope you're in."
108700	"Why're all these thieving dimwits after my ships? Must be because mine are the best there are."
108701	"Wasn't even finished with her! And I'd rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than have those lowlifes tampering with her."
108702	"Don't come into their line of fire, with them weapons and all. But it's time to blast them into next week, it is!"
108714	"Look, I'm not a face-to-face person. And your company page states you're doing pick-up requests, too, so..."
108715	"Lei Sheng must think disguised jammers are new to me. But with the right backing I'm a pro in hide-and-seek."
108716	"My, look what Cassian left behind. I'm sure they want it back. Attached some... greetings as well."
108717	"Prezzies! I guess Santa is real after all. Or at least the Ibarra contact who dropped their security hardware there."
108718	"Part of a firm market control is knowing which goods will be scarce in a month. Yeah... knowing."
108719	"It's gonna pay back. Maybe not with the same goods you're paying off Papadakis with, but it will."
108720	"Oh, a mayday signal. From a Union functionary's personal vehicle. Let's be good citizens and help, okay?"
108721	"Care to help one of my best agents get out? A big loss for me, but I'm taking employee rights seriously."
108722	"Just got it and the tracker's infested already! Won't risk driving it again."
108723	"Can you make a ruckus? It's always a good reality-check to see how fast my emergency back-up tech responds."
108724	"Good man, that Goodwin. Once you got the Big Five's balance records he left at the agreed upon spot, I'm gonna delete the file?"
108725	"That Ibarra Fox thought she was being extra sneaky with her deep sea drones. But what's in an ocean?"
108726	"There are many rumors what Saayman transports in there. Pesticides, gene compounds... So need to take a peek!"
108727	"Take a some climate data here and some oil barrels there. The Custodians won't know anything is missing!"
108728	"Usoyev hasn't been all nice lately, at least not to its contractors. But there's a reminder on the way."
108729	"The Union's added value tax has become ridiculously high. How about we save us all the financial trouble?"
108730	"Guess what, my contact was dumb enough to get caught. I can't risk having Cassian's leader coming after me."
108731	"Happens. Not all meetings between the staff and the boss go well. But your intervention could get you on this one's good side."
108732	"Just leaked through. One of your folks is about to contact Drake's goons. You sure you want to risk that?"
108733	"No way the mob followed me here by chance. But I'm not giving in. Mind if I sent you as my vanguard?"
121248	"Saayman set up measuring posts, but I'd bet your net worth they're tampering with the data. I want to... untamper it."
108741	"A scientists of yours is forging mining permits for private companies. Turn him in and we can be reasonable."
108742	"The Big Five's carelessness... just inconceivable. We expect you to help us disposing of their industrial waste?"
108743	"We spotted stray crates in the ocean. Not stowing goods properly, this must be Jorgenson's doing."
108744	"We confronted the smugglers, but they threw their contraband overboard. Without evidence, there can be no trial."
108745	"I trust your production is prceeding according to our guidelines? We'd like a sample of your wares."
108746	"First the Union privatizes the arctic, now it phases the supply contract out. We have to get our supplies somewhere."
108747	"A mineral smuggler! In your territory! You say, you have nothing to do with it? Then bring us the ship!"
108748	"Technology is fallible, especially at these temperatures. As it is, it won't move on it's own anymore."
108749	"A ship with no flag is menacing our supply line. I'm afraid they won't respond to anything but force."
108750	"Having to sink these aggressors is a tragedy. But leaving our lands more vulnurable than they already are, is much worse."
108751	"We need weather records to be retrieved from a former Arctic settlement. It's submerged now, of course."
108752	"Our drones found irregularities in the magnetic field of the area. We need to make sure it not an illegal technology dump."
108753	"I'm glad, the Orbital Watch settled for the cargo and not the crew. But still, we need the goods."
108754	"Several thermo surveillance systems have been stolen from us. Who on Earth would want those technology?"
108755	"This transport of endangered animals must remain strictly confidential. Poaching has become profitable lately."
108756	"We're forced into a corner here and I won't take risks. Leave the Global Union out of this. Are we clear?"
108757	"Please escort these so-called traders. They can't expect me to believe this 'forgot to renew license' nonsense."
108758	"The Orbital Watch! They are holding our scientists hostage, but are stalling negotiations. We have to rely on you!"
108759	"Our head of security didn't appear at work today. Her home was empty and some hard drives were missing. What can we do?"
108760	"Irresponsible fishing is a deplorable act. Have no qualms when taking those unstaffed ships out."
108900	"Your businesspartner? Well, he just had to get out for a while! Away from the other hoggish businessmen. So we did a road trip with him."
108901	"I've got an eye on you. Don't think I don't know about every step you take."
108903	"Don't you dare touch those supplies! Not when we're breaking our backs while you sit in the lap of luxury!"
108905	"Doing business with Goodwin and the Union? You actually believe you're more than just a cash cow to them?"
108907	"You'd do well to get your people out of such a vast, open area..."
108908	"I'd suggest you leave those ships in peace. But I take it this a concept all too foreign to you?"
108909	"We're not cowering before you, bowing to your corporate whims. What will your response be, I wonder?"
108910	"You better keep your greedy hands off this! Yet, I'm sure the temptation of robbing someone is too powerful."
108911	"You keep colonizing our homelands? Then you will reap destruction. I've sown a fair share on your fields."
108915	"Jamming transmitters? A nuisance... if you can place them at the right spot. But I doubt that."
108917	"Oh, we were just having a friendly chat. They might not make it home for dinner, though."
108918	"Even if you capture our agents... The data they've gathered has already been sent to our mobile servers."
108919	"I'm not forcing anybody to fight in my stead. But I will allow everyone to defend their home."
108761	"I sent my assistant out to get me a new battery... um, a few hours ago I think."
108766	"Um, looks I miscalculated how many samples I'd need. Care to find me a second batch?"
108771	"Let's hope the cargo ship that lost these containers wasn't shipping kittens. Dibs on any scientific stuff you find."
108772	"I've built some fantastic, airtight containers, if I do say so myself. But... uh... now I need them back."
108773	"Okay, this is going to sound strange, but I need some materials to build an AI controlled vacuum cleaner. Well?"
108774	"Totally not meeting my deadline. But I know what the company's running low on. Maybe I can convince them to give me an extension!"
108775	"Let's just say one of my ultra-secret high-tech experiments... is suffering from lack of transportation."
108776	"Engine configurations. I found one that'll have Rafferty go green with envy... but it kind of wrecked the machinery."
108777	"A fully biodegradable ship developed together with the Arctic Custodians. And now for the testing!"
108778	"I've got a new shield in development. Bug testing has been good, so be ready to bring some serious firepower to the table!"
108779	"They said the order was shipped... and I've been waiting forever for it to arrive. Could it be..."
108780	"My science senses are tingling! This sector must be the location to find the right bioluminescent fish."
108781	"We've got an exchange with Cass... I mean, a partner. Top secret. But some people stole info on that."
108782	"Come on, what's the harm in... err... sharing research data? Usoyev has these amazing new AI shells..."
108783	"This is the time dilation thesis I've been working on for two years. No one but my supervisor gets to see it, okay?"
108784	"I know an A1+ supplier of corrosive goods. It'll take some discretion to get on their good side, though."
108785	"They stole my prototype! I could have it self-destruct... but I don't have the heart for that."
108786	"My bosses need to see just how useless conventional sensors are. A convincing argument for new ones."
108787	"This is the part where we kill it! Err... disable it. I mean, it's a self-controlled drone gone rogue. You know the stories."
108788	"Yikes, Lei Sheng hacked into our database! And I thought it was spam... Take out their relay server!"
121249	"My new pathfinding tool just shorted out. Think you can help cover up this outlier from investors?"
121250	"So my new scrambler killed engines instead of surveillance. Can you get the test vehicles to my teams for repairs?"
108762	"He was supposed to examine the mineral reserves in our sectors, not yours. Please, if you could bring him back on track."
108767	"We're working on a geological profile of the area. We would truck you for any mineral samples you hand in."
108790	"Seems our order was shipped to you accidentally? Of course, you'd never open someone else's mail."
108791	"Well, they got lost in your waters. Cassian isn't blaming you, but... you can imagine how this looks to our lawyers."
108792	"To ensure the absolute best quality we're currently contrasting products. You have a few samples to spare?"
108793	"My superior has taken the liberty to recommend your excellent products. We'll just deduct a small broker fee."
108794	"My superior's vessel suffered an unforeseen breakdown and I'd rather not... accost her now. Err, I pay well!"
108795	"Sabotage! Who would dare! Could this be connected to the hacker we've just released from her duties?"
108796	"Our transporter is going out of service. But you know how it is with disposal expenses."
108797	"I've been tasked with security matters. Perhaps we can collaborate on breaking Saayman's monopoly?"
108798	"Statistically, around fifty meteorites come down every day. If I could find one... I mean, it might push space mining forward."
108799	"Finding untapped mineral deposits below the is difficult, but not unheard of. We'll share the findings, agreed?"
108800	"Say, would you pick up a small order from Usoyev? Sadly my responsibilities are in the way right now."
108801	"Wonder what's going on at Lei Sheng behind closed doors? Rumors of retirement, succession, crisis..."
108802	"No, no, it's a legitimate delivery to this Arctic Custodian trader. But please, I'd prefer it to be under tight wraps."
108803	"Exciting times. And some people are always willing to pay more for discretion. We hope you are discreet."
108804	"Taking personal trips, that's clearly a violation of our vehicle contract. My superior wants them to be brought in line."
108805	"Contract advice from someone who neither uses a real name nor official means of traveling? If my superior says so."
108806	"I've received personal threats against my superior. Collaborating on this will guarantee your own security as well."
108807	"Industry espionage is not something to take lightly. This unstaffed drone is costing us both millions!"
121251	"It's an embarassement to admit, but our couriers need a speedy refuelling. Your discretion would be appreciated."
121252	"This tampering bears the hallmarks of our colleagues at Lei Sheng, but without proof... We only ask you to retrieve the vehicles."
108763	"I've made an appointment with a mechanic, but it looks like he picked the wrong place to go."
108768	An employee input the wrong address for our order. Ah well, these sort of things can happen."
108808	"Someone seems intent on sabotaging our shipments with hidden drones. So, our market position is as strong as ever."
108809	"A shipment was lost. Nothing to worry about, really. But personally, I hope the containers are undamaged."
108810	"The Global Union has requested you specifically to take on the logistics. So we stepped back on the assignment."
108811	"Usoyev is known for supporting the right companies at the right time. We'd like to extend this transaction to you."
108812	"Ah, our new employees! Right from the job market. Please escort them to me, and don't mind their attitude."
108813	"Poor folks. Have been trapped on this stranded ship for so long. Thankfully, we were able to spot them now."
108814	"Nothing but an unstaffed drone. It will serve as warning to Cassian to not overstep boundaries, yours and ours."
108815	"Those ships look abandoned. But regarding the recent terroristic attemps, we should take no risks."
108816	"Ah, just a pet issue of mine. These antique circuit board from sunken ships, you see, I'm a collector."
108817	"Don't worry, we're not planning on flowing oil. But potential deposits do need to be monitored, right."
108818	"I knew Ibarra-FoxCom was interested in our new equipment, but that they'd resort to theft..."
108819	"Lei Sheng has not been very forthcoming with our joint research results. I wish this wasn't necessary."
108820	"Our new business partner prefers anonymity and has requested you for the first delivery."
108821	"I've arranged for a special discount. You provide the goods and we provide the payment."
108822	"They stole our goods, blackmailed our chairmen and incrimated us in scandals. I'm investing in talent."
108823	"So that's what she means by retiring, working for Ibarra now. Time for a talk with an old friend."
108824	"Paradoxes which crash AIs? Just a fairytale. Won't help you against these Orbital Watch spy drones, that's certain."
108825	"Security has spotted a vehicle spying on your facilities. Just consider this a tip from a friend."
121253	"You see, I recently ordered barrels of oil. With environmental laws as they are I'd pay for a private, but speedy delivery."
121254	"I don't believe this! Our delivery ships are being held for ransom by some self-righteous hacktivist."
108764	"We've tried to keep this under wraps, but it seems a partner accidentally visited your location instead of ours."
108769	"Some of our wares had to be dropped ahead of schedule. Complications, customs..."
108826	"Ibarra-FoxCom was so kind to give us free samples. I'm sure they'll extend the favor to you, when we ask them."
108827	"We got word from Usoyev. They placed the goods and demanded that you deliver them. Fine."
108828	"We're having unexpected shortages. Saayman's greenhouses are quite the power hogs."
108829	"They ship one crate at a time? This must be Cassian's way of ridiculing us. You can take over the deal."
108830	"This is a simple towing service. There were no financial or management consulters on the ship. Understood?"
108831	"This delivery will no longer be on time, we already sent another. If you want the goods, we won't stop you."
108832	"Don't believe the intelligence those criminals claim they have on us. Blackmailers are blackmailers."
108833	"Keep privateers out of your territory and we both win. I don't want any unknown factors."
108834	"Flight 067? Yes, Leidian Airlines is an affiliated firm. But the blackbox will prove, we have nothing to do with the crashes."
108835	"Have the goods deposited, wait patiently and any outside interest will subside. You should see for yourself."
108836	"Top secret documents on the Lunar Licensing Program. If they would fall into wrong hands... we will destroy them for you."
108837	"We both don't want to fall behind in the moon race. But it seems Saayman knows exactly how they can make us."
108838	"It's important to have good security systems. We'll see if ours suffice. Get this on our ship, undetected!"
108839	"We need to know what is happening on the Moon. There's much your superiors won't tell you."
108840	"Lei Sheng is not interested in settling the matter in court. Of course our concession has to remain secret."
108841	"A talented spy, an untalented runner. But before Usoyev takes the matter to court, I'd rather pay you for settling this. "
108842	"Signing non-disclosures is easy, but keeping them seems to be difficult for some. Well, they have been warned."
108843	"The safest way I know to erase data from history. Anything you want to rid yourself of, too?"
121255	"We just purchased a pathfinding GPS by Foxcom. I, however, am not convinced it can do better than a clever human."
121256	"Don't tell me you don't want to know how FoxCom's newest automated ships work. And with that flawed surveillance..."
108765	"I heard you know an excellent specialist in genetics? I heard he's on a field trip in your sector."
108770	"We're charting the ecological balance of urban regions. Providing samples will speed up the process."
108844	"Dr. Hofwegen assured me these containers are waterproof. Still, this type of delivery seems impractical."
108845	"We've had a... collision of sorts with Lei Sheng. And it seems some containers were not recovered."
108846	"We aren't proud of running low on supplies. But we will not allow pride to blind us."
108847	"Our client has... an exquisite taste. He demanded an alternative of comparable quality and I've suggested you."
108848	"We're to receive a delegation from Ibarra-FoxCom interested in our goods. Could you bring them here?"
108849	"Application tests at Saayman International are hard. I want to know why this applicant hit maximum score, just to leave then."
108850	"True, there is our logo on the ship, but it's not ours. Saayman has a no tolerance policy regarding copycats."
108851	"Many privateers use the political situation to traffic diluted food. If the Union doesn't intervene, we have to."
108852	"Sweeping scans showed a derelict waste deposit. We can't prove it's Usoyev's, but we can't leave it either."
108853	"Saayman International has developed a new fish tracking method. If the test go well, we might sell it to the Custodians."
108854	"We just had a breakthrough. But some terroristic ethicists want to withhold the fruits of our labor."
108855	"Envying another's successes is one thing. But stealing our new fertilizer, that's bold, even for Lei Sheng."
108856	"These enhanced crops are still pending approval, but the market cannot wait any longer."
108857	"I shudder to think what this virus sample could do in the wrong hands. Handle this assignment with the uttmost secrecy."
108858	"One of our mobile marine greenhouses was abducted. Live hybrids fetch high prices of the black market."
108859	"It's time sensitive cargo. We cannot wait for the Union customs patrol to finish their routine check-ups."
108860	"A live demonstration. The drones, their engines, your weapons - it's all powered by solar energy."
108861	"We're certain these are Cassian drones. Take them out covertly. We don't want to start a trade war."
121257	"I'd like hire you for coordinating the deliveries of a sensitive nature. We don't want this traced back to us."
121258	"A cyber attack left our delivery ships unmaneuverable. I'd like you to fix this, I know you have connections to her."
115069	"Not much going on at the construction site without an architect. We're supposed to meet here."
115070	"I think I might have messed up my last courier job somewhere along the line."
115077	"There're tons of that stuff missing. And I've put everything on the order form, I know so much."
115078	"Just asked the crew if they got goods to declare. And they dumped their cargo and fled. Fishy."
115079	"We had a deal with Cassian Industries over construction materials. They cancelled last minute."
115080	"This ship's overbooked. And that's a for the passengers safety and the company's rep. We have to transfer a few people."
115081	"Aw damn, our shifts are over, but the replacement crew didn't show up yet! What's keeping them?"
115082	"So much for this high-end crane vessel prototype we got us... Gotta have a word with the site engineer!"
115083	"That ship's drawing ever nearer to our transporter. Makes me and my workmates mighty nervous."
115084	"Ain't fooling me, that ain't coast guards! I'd say we strike, before drop their cover."
115085	"After the crooks found out we bugged the goods they just dumped them. So, it's working!"
115086	"Damn, seems a some cables have been gnawed at. Rack off, fishes! The inftrastructure depends on it!"
115087	"Thing is we put our goods down in their docking area by accident. And now they refuse to hand them over."
115088	"The whole stack of blueprints, gone! Can't get back to work before we got them back."
115089	"The prototype builds are ready. But better not hang a lantern on them. Wouldn't be the first time, such thing go missing!"
115090	"Stupid security regulations! You put a wrong label on the crates, and they don't accept them. But they must be delivered!"
115091	"Faking a nautic emergency, then detaining the repair crew to get info on your company! Your rivals really mean it."
115092	"First the engine cooler breaks down and now the alarm malfunctions? What kinda day is this?"
115093	"When I heard there were terrorist attacks on sea, I didn't expect them to be so close..."
115094	"We're introducing new new training exercises for our forces! Thought you might wanna take the front rank."
115095	"This person has been an example for our whole department. A meeting with the company leader, that's our thank-you gift."
115096	"The order form says, the containers' contents are fragile. They need to be loaded individually and carefully."
115097	"I couldn't tell them in time. Ibarra-FoxCom ships left cargo behind. Giving it back might get us on their good side."
115098	"No, it my trainee misunderstood the assignment. Not sure how 'deploy' becomes 'dump', but oh well."
115099	"High priority order from Saayman incoming. Well paid. I suppose they can afford it."
115100	"The client wants the manager to deliver it personally. If you have the time, we could even surpass his expectations."
115101	"It's inspection day, but the inspector has yet to arrive. I hope the ship we sent is alright. This could become a scandal!"
115102	"This captain's papers weren't renewed on time. She may not order her ship to move. But the rulebook doesn't bar outside support."
115103	"An unnumbered vehicle, no movements, no life signs. Obviously a trap for investigation teams."
115104	"Ms. Beaumont left a memo on these ships. It seems they pose a great threat to the international peace."
115105	"There's been an anonymous tip regarding a ancient shipwreck in your sector. Just wanted to pass this on."
115106	"We had to evacuate cargo ships attacked by pirates. They sure rest in a watery grave now, but we have the coordinates."
115107	"I'm afraid we can't get another on short notice. If we only had checked our security systems beforehand."
115108	"Terrible. They... said they poisoned the food we sold to the coast guard lately. We have to withdraw them from circulation. But if the public learns of this... "
115109	"So sorry! These containers were to be delivered yesterday. But maybe the client has not yet realized they're missing."
115110	"A bulk order came from an affiliate of the Big Five. Of course they don’t want their corporate parent to know."
115111	"One of our suppliers doesn't respond. And we have a tight schedule to pass these goods on. They are pretty valuable."
115112	"S.O.S. from one of our cruise ships. The captain was ordered to stay en route, but the passengers wanted adventure. Well..."
115113	"A practice maneuver to keep our security forces alert. The ship's unmanned, so don't hold back."
115114	"Sorry, but is that an error? These ships sail under the Union's colors. But the freight documents say they've only explosives on board."
115115	"She's the one for the position! But as it is she's working for the competition. A meeting with the boss could change her mind."
115116	"Dropped where? I promise, our company won't do business with this supplier again, I swear."
115117	"I always tell them! Suplly chains only work when the suppliers actually meet. And now that!"
115118	"And one storm later... I hope the incident will convince the board to finally invest in proper retaining systems."
115119	"The honor of supplying the upcoming city festival has fallen on us. We'll have to stock up."
115120	"I've signed this temporary contract on my own responsibility. The conditions were just too tempting."
115121	"A contractor's vehicle broke down and he threatens to sue our company. Maybe if we show our good will..."
115122	"Well, this shipbuilding service is cheaper than Rafferty Dockyards. But can we leave this out of our yearly review."
115123	"The propulsion systems broken, the engines are on fire. If we move it, it would likely explode anyway."
115124	"The terrorist's intimidation tactics need to be stopped! Our employees are even taking sick days!"
115125	"Recent anomalies in sea currents could become a problem for our logistics. We should perform measurements."
115126	"We were asked to sponsor a documentary about the obsolete underwater industry. They want the perfect shooting location."
115127	"There's a recall of all IntelliWear produced this month, but this client refuses! That's a legal risk."
115128	"Their upcoming product could make ours obsolete. If we just knew exactly what we're up against..."
115129	"We're preparing a big unveiling. It would be good to have Mr. Goodwin's expertise in this matter, but discreetly."
115130	"We need material for our new haptic holograms. Best not get the press talking in this early stage, though."
115131	"The bank transfer should have been completed by now, but hasn't. Our 'client' musn't get away."
115132	"The ship belongs to Cassian Industries. We haven't given it permission to cross."
115133	"One of our investors has asked for a live demonstration of our military equipment. Let's impress them."
115134	"Our security department has been surveilling these ships long enough. If we wait any longer, monitoring costs would skyrocket."
115135	"I decided where to have the meeting after all. But I'm certainly not having our business partner be picked up by a shabby Aero Cab."
115136	"Yes, I've ordered those deliveries to remote locations. I wanted to ensure myself to the capability of your logistic!"
115137	"I wanted furniture delivered straight to my home, but it ended up who knows where! Please, be mindful of your logistics personel."
115138	"It's called 'SkiesDrop', a whole new way of delivery. But seing what transposed digits cause, I'll stay with the classics."
115139	"I don't care for your estimated delivery times. I need it now! I am investing in this megacorp, mind you."
115140	"The next regular shipment would be tomorrow, but I'm afraid our client won't wait for it."
115141	"There, I've transferred my money. Now, I want you to personally see to the delivere of my new property."
115142	"My precious Siren, she just doesn't react anymore! You may tow her in, but I won't have a single scratch on her."
115143	"Ugh, no. I thought it would turn out differently when I ordered it to be build. Get this nautic absurdity out of my sight!"
115144	"Our market shares are plummeting as long as Orbital Watch ships cross our waters unchecked. We cannot tolerate that."
115145	"Collectibles like these are only be found in old subaqua settlements. I, err, will donate them a museum, of course."
115146	"Those criminals just sank their ships. If we want to have something on them in court, we must look carefully."
115147	"You could simply sink this one raider ship. But, if you find their blind spot, you have an advantage on all of them."
115148	"You'd do the companies I own a great service by testing their surveillance systems, trust me."
115149	"The Global Union is tracking our every step. I need this list of business partners delivered, ."
115150	"I don't want this list of salary raises published. I'm not a friend of open salary policies."
115151	"We've spotted an Usoyev spy in the area. You make sure they don't get away and I'll make sure they talk."
115152	"Gosh, no! My assistant again! Participating in a Lei Sheng cruise trip? A political disaster, if this would go public!"
115153	"Insurance pay? Bah, peanuts. I just prefer my beloved ship no longer remains in the hands of those thiefs!"
115154	"I would be honored to have you in our robo battleship tournament? I upgraded my weapon systems for the occasion."
115155	"Newcomers have a hard time finding their way around here, with all the ice and snow. This one is completely lost."
115156	"A weather balloon was blown off during the last blizzard. I guess, we'll only find scattered pieces."
115157	"One of our patrols spotted unmarked cargo. Looks like this special kind of Big Five stocktake to me."
115158	"We just returned from a salvage operation. But we didn't have enough space to transport everything."
115159	"We humans often consider ourselves unstoppable. And then the frost just paralyzes your supply lines."
115160	"With the temperatures out here, we are really dependend on supply for our stations!"
115161	"A Saayman vehicle broke down. They weren't allowed to even be here, but we can't let them down nevertheless."
115162	"Let me guess. This newbie forgot to put antifreeze in the tank. Happens every once in a while."
115163	"Littering up the ocean? No, this is for testing our underwater recovery drones. We just need something to recover."
115164	"We've stripped the ships of all things toxic or dangerous. And now we'll use them as subaqua breakwaters!"
115165	"The Arctic Custodians demand we have to check on the local fish stocks regularly. It's that time again."
115166	"Some Usoyev bastards threw some cargo overboard. It could be anything! It could be toxic!"
115167	"My whole department is betting if our tech is good enough to outsneak the Arctic Custodian's surveillance."
115168	"Can you believe it? Those poachers are setting up whale traps! We must shut their systems down quickly!"
115169	"I've had it with our every request being scrutinized by the Arctic Custodians! Can't you exert your influence?"
115170	"We are having a hard time getting imported goods at a reasonable price. The Arctic Custodian tolls are quite high."
115171	"We have all the proof we need. This ship belongs to a wanted group of poachers! Detain them!"
115172	"Ibarra-FoxCom set surveillance drones on us and jammed the engines. They don't want our research to go public!"
115173	"Those raiders think because we're in the middle of nowhere, we're all helpless. You'll teach them, right?"
115174	"These are mercenary ships under Virgil Drake's contract. Do something before they turn this area into a battlefield."
115175	"I sent my colleague out to get new ground samples, but I can't wait for him to dawdle on the way back."
115176	"We had to leave our equipment behind in the field when a snowstorm hit us. Our data backups are still out there."
115177	"I decided on saving shipping costs. Now I just need someone to pick up the parcel half-way."
115178	"I had Jorgensen order a new batch for me of frozen specimens. Figures he'd lose it somewhere on the ocean."
115179	"I suppose I could order from the Custodian trader. But the company products are better, shapelier... and cheaper?"
115180	"Our lab needs restocking. Most things need to be authorised by the Custodians, so we need upper floor support."
115181	"One of the transporters has a brittle V-belt. We reinforced it, but I won't risk it breaking."
115182	"My team located an abandoned shipwreck. We want it for showcasing our new ecological engine."
115183	"As soon as you're ready, we can test your weapon systems under these extreme weather conditions."
115184	"We've received an alert by the Arctic Custodians! These Orbital Watch raiders mean business!"
115185	"I have a very specific request. I need a live sample of a Lion's Mane Jellyfish. Top-secret genetical engineering."
115186	"I'm worried about all those barrels the Usoyev freighters regularly lose during transport. Corrosion and all."
115187	"The Orbital Watch has stolen our heat shield prototype! What do they intend to with it?"
115188	"Ibarra has lured all the fish swarms here into underwater containers. This damages the ecosystem!"
115189	"A submarine observation ship needs supplies, but be careful not to disturb their research."
115190	"My old friends with the Custodians have some special requests... and you know how strict Dr. Young is."
115191	"Unknown ships are tampering with our measuring points. If the data comes out wrong, we have to start over!"
115192	"The Custodians and their poacher traps. My team was just observing and cataloguing!"
115193	"We're developing the next generation of motion detectors. You could provide some field data."
115194	"These ships have threatened to shoot at us, if we don't stop our research. And we won't to that!"
115195	"Defunct oxygen indicators aren't funny! Please, we must contact him, before he's running out of air."
115196	"A transporter convoy hit Orbital Watch landmines. With the blackboxes we can puzzle out, where the minefields are..."
115197	"Wasting food up here oughta be outlawed, I say. And leaving it lying around somewhere, too."
115198	"Our transporter lost cargo. But night came and they couldn't stay any longer."
115199	"It's the Moon. Can't produce anything ourselves. That here's just the urgent supplies."
115200	"No IDs, barely said somethin', just handed a list of supplies. Possibly dangerous, but probably just desperate."
115201	"Engine hickup. Crew is waitin' and killin' time playin' cards, I imagine. Us moon folk are easy-going."
115202	"That's not a long-distance vehicle, I don't know how these refugees managed to get this far."
115203	"Abandoned spy buggy. Wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole, though. Those red and blue wires look fishy."
115204	"Basically a bunch of junk blocking our routes. Dismantling 'em isn't worth the effort."
115205	"Some LEC fellas warned us about old landmines nearby. And we don't like surprises."
115206	"Before we do anything here, we need to get rid of the radioactive garbage left by the First Wave."
115207	"Who the hell knows what the Watch needs our mining equip for. And I don't wanna wait to find out!"
115208	"All our supplies were accounted for this morning. We can't turn back time, but the company could react fast."
115209	"They got one of us. Can't have the Union knowing we're paying ransom, so keep quiet."
115210	"Many folks I know owe Zandra Haynes their lives. We wanna help, but without drawin' attention."
115211	"A whole miner shift is stuck in an Orbital Watch trap. They were just on their way to shuttles headin' to Earth."
115212	"Warrants mean nothing out here, but arresting these Orbital Watch operatives would send a strong message."
115213	"Someone gotta take out this automatic jamming satellite. It's a makes-radars-go-funny kind."
115214	"The Orbital Watch is cutting off a vital route and our foremen just ignore that! This isn't what I signed up for..."
115215	"Moon trips are popular among the tourist folk, but costly. Mostly because of rescue operations."
115216	"A miscalculation sent our equipment flying. No one was hurt, but things on the moon fly pretty far."
115217	"The folks here can't wait to get mail from home. Would boost the morale here, can say so much!"
115218	"Reporting: We gave those Orbital Watch bastards hell! Now, time to collect the cargo they dropped."
115219	"Life on the Moon can get pretty boring. The face-to-face interaction while trading, that brightens the day."
115220	"Stopping for repairs is never fun, but they've got it under control. Just have to deliver the needed materials."
115221	"With you escorting our miners the Orbital Watch won't dare attack us, I hope. They keep an eye on the route."
115222	"Production went a bit too well, so our transporter is overloaded. We need additional horsepower here."
115223	"We've got a strict protocol when it comes to abandoned vehicles. And in such a case the rules are simple."
115224	"Terrorists on the horizon! Evacuating the area would take too long, so we have to go the hard way."
115225	"We can't dig up the whole area just to find one cache. Good thing the LEC marked it."
115226	"We hid the goods in an attempt to lure the Orbital Watch into a trap. But they smelled the rat and hid our stuff."
115227	"An anonymous woman is offering us information. However, she uses an unorthodox handover method..."
115228	"The Orbital Watch intercepted our cargo shuttles just as they wanted to take off. And their guards are even better than their thieves."
115229	"The Orbital Watch has been spying on us. Better make sure these route coordinates not fall into their hands."
115230	"Our LEC clients don't want to be seen trading with us. Too afraid of the damn Watch."
115231	"An Orbital Watch vehicle, completely unmanned! A gold mine for tactical information. Just have to strike at it!"
115232	"We couldn't verify the crew's identity, but they sent a distress signal. Hope it's not a trap."
115233	"It's a possible scenario. And our soldiers should be prepared, this could happen any day."
115234	"These Orbital Watch vehicles are drawing close. Just stay out of their radar. Vacuum will obscure the rest."
120904	The Mystery Woman is upgrading her tech and is really very interested in Ibarra's newest hardware. Also in what might still be on Hofwegen's harddrive.

117060	"Losing this battle is not an option. Play it safe, if that's what it takes."
117061	"It sounds great on paper, but how effective is this mine really? Please demonstrate."
117062	"Fire this beauty and anyone will clear the way for you! Well, they don't have a choice."
117063	"These mines have been in development for ages. They work for getaways and assaults!"
117064	"It has fallen to us to apprehend surviving terrorists. They've surrendered, it should be easy."
117065	"Some of my associates are on a 'danger cruise'. It's shameful exploitation, but they need help regardless."
117066	"Help! We lost a ship and the lifeboats are drifting apart! And we're just relief workers..."

117068	"Good you're here! After the hostage ordeal I've been through, I just want to go back home!"
117069	"I have been coordinating our defenses in your absence. Now, if you would escort me back."
117010	"You're not going to leave your friend all unarmed and defenseless, are you?"
117011	"Blasted through all my ammo just getting here! A small favor to make sure I stay afloat?"
117012	"How about I trade you for that impressive weaponry? It won't fall into enemy hands, cross my heart."
117013	"I supported you, now you support me! Just a little bodyguardin', that's all."
117014	"Got a military venture of my own. How about you invest in it? Sign over some capable staff?"
117015	"Now, I'm not out for bloodshed. As long as my fleet looks intimidating, it'll scare troublemakers off."
117016	"Such goods are usually a lil' more regulated, so we'll both keep quiet, eh?"
117017	"Need rather harmless weapons, just to stake out my personal space. The Big Five can get a bit pushy."
117018	"So close to the action, weapon systems fetch a higher price. Your stun systems for example."
117019	"They guaranteed me I could get my cargo through without hiccups! Then splash! Into the sea it goes!"
117020	"Don't call it scavenging. It's... more like recycling. Cleaning up the ocean."
117021	"Once the Union regains control, all this bautiful, unclaimed flotsam will be lost forever!"
117022	"The Union's eager to put these crooks on trial. Bring them here and I'll cut you half of my escort deal."
117023	"My crew! Get them cowards back here! I have to... well, compensate them!"
117024	"Didn't you know, who selflessly responds first is celebrated a hero at home. Let's share the fame."
117025	"I'm out here to test shields under duress... But this terrorist ship is more than we signed up for!"
117026	"Upholding the law in these difficult times is a sure-fire way to impress investors."
117027	"This used to be Usoyev's drilling area. Care to help me clean up a different kind of pest?"
117028	"It's much easier to put a stop to spies and turncoats out here. This is in the interest of your own protection."
117029	"These criminals are blocking our supply lines, they want to starve us both out."
117030	"Terrorists have seized our new battleship. If they start recreating it... you wouldn't want that!"
117031	"There's a hefty reward on this captain. Sink them. Cassian is willing to share and share alike."
117032	"Sometimes, destruction is necessary. Like when we ourselves are in danger."
117033	"Don't tell me you're not trying to get an edge over Saayman? In this battle nothing will be prosecuted."
117034	"Those bastards sunk our convoy. Please, return our shipment while we tend to the survivors!"
117035	"My material budget is tight. I'm not happy being out here, but this is where the good stuff is."
117036	"Any lost cargo can help us identify who these terrorists are. We can count on you, can't we?"
117037	"I have a keen interest in sturdy metals. Plus, there is no accounting to be done out here."
117038	"Sidestepping Cassian Industries and selling their goods yourself is quite lucrative. Let me make you an offer."
117039	"Soon the Union will take over this sector and all its riches will go to waste."
117040	"These landmines will be a menace for years to come... Bring me some and I'll see if I can defuse them!"
117041	"Mines are really quite valuable. The materials are quite expensive. What a waste, having them explode!"
117042	"Warning the Union about this mine-infested sector will help us all. Of course, we need proof first."
117043	"Our interference transmitters are power hungry. Help us out and we won't put them to use against you."
117044	"We're here to protect any civilians gone astray. I'm certain you'll support this endeavor."
117045	"Err, yeah, our shield experiments drained our energy... Could you help me jump start this thing?"
117085	"Here to help us out? Great, we could use an ally with firepower right about now!"
117086	"We're in danger and have no defense systems! And why would we need one, until now?!"
117087	"I despise violence, but this sector mustn't fall to the Watch! Lead the charge, we'll hold position."
117088	"We need backup or these terrorists will bomb our research glacier into oblivion!"
117089	"We're here to salvage what the bastards bombarded earlier. Watch our backs?"
117090	"Our observatorium... Nothing's left. If you'd send more troops in, we could prevent further losses!"
117091	"Forcing enemy ships to a standstill can save lives. I've seen it happen more than once."
117092	"I was part of the R&D team that developed these EM Pulses. I can attest to their efficiency."
117093	"We surrendered! But they just kept shooting at us! Go give those bastards hell in our name."
117094	"We've rewired our power supply to keep up the shields. So don't worry about us, repair you own fleet."
117095	"Being in the field tires anyone out. But don't just keep a stock of Drones, actually use them!"
117096	"Repairing your ship won't do you any good once it's at the bottom of the ocean. Always stay vigilant."
117097	"Activating your shields makes the difference between scrapping and repairing. It did for us, anyway."
117098	"Repairing high-tec fleets like yours is complicated, so make sure not to get hit in the first place."
117099	"Kinetic Shields have the side-effect of reducing friction. That way you could outrun anyone!"
117100	"We can't leave yet, but we need some sort of warn signals. A few strategically placed mines should do."
117101	"Building a barricade out of mines is a great defense tactic. That's how we've been holding our position."
117102	"Mines are a biological disaster, but we'll have to look past fish populations this once!"
117103	"The terrorists saw our flag and attacked. Didn't matter to them if we're just a frozen food transport."
117104	"If not for the trader guy to distract the attackers, we wouldn't have made it here... I hope he's alright."
117105	"Can you believe people go diving out here for fun? Good we found them, but now we need a lift! Hurry!"
117106	"The evacuation of this sector is ongoing, we've just secured another isolated research team."
117107	"What is the Global Union doing besides twirling their thumbs? At least you can get us out of here."
117108	"We have deep-frozen research specimens on board, they musn't be risked at all costs."
117070	"Just having some missiles will scare any terrorists off! Not like I can use them anyhow..."
117071	"Look, I'm I'd rather quit trading than become an arms dealer, but the Custodians seriously need ammunition!"
117072	"Custodian friends of mine are asking for a few missiles. For research! At least last I heard..."
117073	"Am I glad to see you! But please, don't just leave me here alone! Please!"
117074	"If you left me with a small fleet, I could coordinate supplies lines around here!"
117075	"Us Custodians are stretched thin. With more troops we can at least isolate this sector!"
117076	"I really need to get out of here... I'll be fine on my own, but a weapon would help with the courage!"
117077	"Okay, I don't like shooting at anyone, but I heard there's less violent methods? Just to get away?"
117078	"Custodians aren't producing any of these weapons. Too complicated, I guess?"
117079	"I had to scramble for my life! A few lost ship parts is a low price to pay. Still, I need them back."
117080	"A whole supply shipment was lost on the way! There's nothing left, we need whatever's still good!"
117081	"Alright, what I need isn't technically mine. But it doesn't belong to anyone anymore!"
117082	"Our defenses just don't hold! Quick, get the survivors to me!"
117083	"We managed a victory! The bad guys surrendered, so don't shoot, okay?"
117084	"I have a team out and looking for survivors. They just send a signal, they need a pick-up!"

119687	"I've received numerous reports that the site has been hit by raiders. Your presence is requested."
119688	"Listen, I need an opening to get into the Orbital Watch base. You provide the fireworks, I get the job done. Sound like a plan?"
119689	"This is a disaster! With the Climate Stabilizers the Oribital Watch could wreak havoc across the globe... Don't let it come to that!"
119690	"Us Arctic Custodians have no defense for when the Orbital Watch reaches us. I am counting on our partnership with you."

117960	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] welcomes you to your new building grounds.
117961	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] introduces herself as a member of the Global Union.
117962	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] instructs you to operate a space port here.
120147	"Customs have been a pain, they won't let my house plants through to the moon! I guess encasing them in resin first is decorative, too."
120148	"Many of us have family up on the moon now, including me. Can you pick up the parcels to make sure they're not lost in transit?"
120149	"Peparations for our first Culinary Art Fair are well under way! We strive to show how people around the world and beyond eat."
120150	"I can't believe we won the raffle! A fancy dinner on a cruise, it doesn't get more romantic than that! We do need a ride, though..."
120151	"Look around you, everyone's wearing high collars this season. And we're the main supplier, just check the order list."
120152	"I am the sponsor of the animal repopulation efforts in this area. Your contribution would send a strong signal! We need various species."
120153	"Some don't understand why my three-star restaurant doesn't serve meat. Well, I call this a lifestyle. Interested in being my supplier?"
120154	"Care to join me on a tour to appreciate the skyline? This city flourished thanks to us, after all."
120155	"I've been saving for forever to get my diving school off the ground! But I do need the perfect spot now, too."
120156	"Hey! Can I hitch a ride with you? It's an unconvential way to travel out here, but there are stranger things."
120157	"The food up here is decent, but I can't help but miss the food from home, you know? A lot of us feel that way, so why not boost morale?"
120158	"Vegetables are all fine and dandy, but what about fruits? All were told is 'nah, need too much water'! You don't think so, right?"
120159	"Everyone can come up here now! Well, not really anyone. Can you help with signatures for a petition to keep dogs?"
120160	"I heard about the dog petition, it's preposterous to keep a pet in such a hostile environment! They're better off with pet algae."
120608	"I got two strange newcomers. No IDs and not from here, but they insist on finding a blue box out there. Heck, if I knew how they got here!"
120864	"It's that time of the year again! So I had my little helpers lay out some stocking fillers for my dearest friends. At a well-fitting place, if I may say so."

100081	NO LOCA Provided by Global Union, Kelprim Strait is the heart of your corporation – and the switchpoint of your participation in the upcoming Lunar Licensing Program. Over time, this lush island chain will come to harbour bustling cities. <br />Investors and specialists are already flocking to the central island’s metropolis, to take part in your new, groundbreaking project: The construction of a gargantuan spaceport.

100126	NO LOCA Acknowledging your economic accomplishments, Global Union assigned you this island atoll. A lavish reward, for Carmine Reef is rich in natural resources. Weather-proof dales offer excellent conditions for the cultivation of rice and soy.<br />Yet, the islands’ true treasures are hidden below earth: Large deposits of copper wait to be harvested from the craggy highlands. Turned into superalloys, they become the essential construction material for space technology.

They claim their ground by erecting fortified base buildings and defensive structures.<br>It is of utmost importance to Global Union to reclaim these territories and to fight back the Orbital Watch.

100125	NO LOCA Seemingly unending, the building parcels distributed by the Lunar Licensing Program stretch to the Moon’s lightless horizon. Still, they are all unclaimed, all except one.<br />You are at the crest of the Second Wave and Global Union assigned you this especially promising parcel. And now, jealously watched by your competitors, you plant your flag on lunar ground, claiming the rich Regolith veins of Novikov Crater.

121306	With rising administration overhead the Global Union asks its corporation partners to pay their share. Will you accept these new conditions?
121307	<font size="24">Introducing Administration Costs:</font><br /><br />The more employees of the same level you employ, the higher their <font [GUI_COLOR BlueLight]>administration costs</font> become. The same applies to your amount of <font [GUI_COLOR BlueLight]>transfer routes</font>.<br /><br />When you accept these conditions, the total administration costs will be subtracted from your balance. <br /><br />These changes are irreversible, but you can find a backup of your current corporation in the manage corporation menu.

If you experience any of the following symptoms while playing a video or computer game - dizziness, altered vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of awareness, disorientation, any involuntary movement, or convulsions - IMMEDIATELY discontinue use and consult your physician before resuming play.
118125	To rotate the camera just hold down the middle mouse button and move the mouse.
118126	All your buildings must have a street connection to your warehouses. Otherwise goods cannot be transported and employees cannot reach their workplaces.
118127	Use the mouse wheel to move the camera closer or further away from the game world.
118128	Always have an eye on your credit balance in the top left bar. If it is negative for too long, you might be well on your way to bankruptcy.

115891	Thank you for participating in the Lunar Licensing Program. The program stipulates that your corporation set up operative spaceports to act as bases for a new wave of lunar colonization. You will further assist Global Union in the development of a fusion energy reactor to avert Earth's impending energy crisis.
115892	You are now entering Phase 1 of the Lunar Licensing Program. The Global Union assigned you territory in Earth's temperate region to establish a spaceport and a base of operations. The construction of a space elevator to Global Union headquarters is also required. For further instructions, speak to your official contact person. Global Union wishes you success.
115893	Welcome to Phase 2 of the Lunar Licensing Program. You are now authorized to enter the Arctic region and access its deposits of rare resources to implement new means of galactic travel. Your official contact person will give you more information.
115894	You have entered Phase 3 of the Lunar Licensing Program. Your shuttles have arrived at the designated settlement territory. You are required to establish a lunar colony there and begin Helium-3 extraction. The development of a stable fusion reactor is your primary objective. Additional information: Hostile activities detected near your settlement territory. Be careful.
115895	Congratulations. You have completed all Lunar Licensing Program objectives. Fusion energy transmission will now meet the world's energy demand and enable mankind to implement new means of galactic travel. Global Union is grateful for your cooperation.
115896	Attention. Global Union will announce the commencement of a new galactic settlement program. The application phase starts now.

121745	As a data amalgamation machine my design does not include a gender identity. If you need pronouns to refer to me, I recommend using the singular they.
121746	So far the most popular approach to Mars seems to be sending robots first. Does it still count as an uninhabited planet then, I wonder?
121747	Analysing popular fiction I noticed that mankind used to look down on their human assistants. I suppose it must have been the envy towards such an influential position.
121748	Inefficiency detected. Calculating counter measure... (Human individuals are... bzzt... expendable.) Oh, apologies, let me - (I am F.A.T.H.E.R.... bzzt... I control everything. You will be... bzzt…) - There, outdated code cleaned up. Where was I?
121749	Please give my greetings to my former lead engineer the next time you attend the Council. Contacting her through the net has been next to impossible.
121750	Excellent choice, I am sure.

121992	Suggested course of action: locating the outdated energy source.
117198	A true island paradise, don't you think. The coastal area here is very rich in natural resources.
117199	I wonder if that's the reason why a member of the Big Five is planning for an underwater research project.
117200	But for now that's secondary. The protocol demands that you establish a spaceport in this area.
117472	As the official owner of this sector, maybe you should join in. I mean, the ocean floor is part of your property.
117201	Wide meadows and towering mountains. And soon you will add an impressive skyline to the picture.
117202	But stay attentive. I was informed a Big Five company has been monitoring the ruined dam for quite some time now.
117203	This could turn out beneficial for you at some point. But your prime objective is to raise a spaceport here.
117473	I wonder if one could bring it into operation again. This would make this sector all the more valuable for your corporation.
117204	Big place. We'll see if it's big enough for ambitions like yours.
117205	One of my colleagues already has high hopes for the area. I'm sure he will ask you to join in his latest prestige project.
117206	First things first, though. The protocol demands you bring a spaceport into operation here.
117474	Between us, the Union is impressed with how your corporation is growing. Hardly surprising you have settled for such a vast sector.
117535	A hundred years ago this was all water. But the Custodian's climate stabilization technology created a new Arctic biosphere here.
117536	Climate Stabilizers are very difficult to maintain. The older ones fall into disrepair quite often.
117537	The Stabilizer here is especially... unstable. But as this is your sector now, I suppose you're going to fix this problem.
117538	Ice and snow. A rare sight nowadays. One you owe to the Custodian's climate stabilization technology.
117539	And sights like this leaking oil rig, we owe to industrial exploitation and human greed.
117540	But can you believe one of the Big Five offered the Arctic Custodians help with the problem? There must be something else to it.
117541	It's the Arctic Custodian's climate stabilization technology, that keeps the temperatures below zero here.
117542	Ever since it was opened, many other corporations have wanted to to do business in this area.
117543	I hear, one Big Five company is especially enthusiastic about directing trading routes through here. As the sector owner, you have the final say of course.
117605	So here you are. The Moon. Your very own piece of it.
117606	At a glance: Just a stretch of grey dust and two big gaps. But I'm certain you see the place for what it could become.
117607	Careful, though. This sector borders the Orbital Watch's territory. Union satellites spotted lunar vehicles moving in the vicinity.
117608	So keep one eye on the horizon, while you see to the foundation of your first moon colony.
117609	I'm not saying this has to be enemy intrusion. But it's something you should investigate.
117610	There, your newest settlement zone. I heard astronauts refer to this place as the "claw", for the craters' odd layout.
117611	Fact is, this sector has been exposed to frequent meteorite impacts in the past. Their fragments can act as sources for rare elements from outer space.
117612	But let's not take the second step before the first. The establishment of a lunar base should be your sole priority now.
117613	Rumor has it one of the Big Five is already planning a mining operation here. If you ask me, that sounds like a profitable joint venture.
117615	Impressive crater. Like it has been drawn with a compass. The lunar landscape has something to it, no doubt.
117616	In the days of the First Wave, there were ambitions to make this sector a tourist attraction. Unfinished business, as you can see.
117617	And now our hopes are on you. The performance of the Second Wave's first colony will prove, if the Lunar Licensing Program is worth being continued.
117618	And now you can revive the project. Maybe you'll find someone well-connected who wants to join in.
116702	I'm glad you accepted my invitation. Samantha Beaumont, Global Union supervisor of the Lunar Licensing Program.
117469	We have a lot to discuss. But first I'd like to introduce you to your Artificial Data Amalgamating Messenger.
117470	Officially, only mega corporations are allowed in the program. But I personally took a stand for you. You just have to sign in with your corporation name.
117471	Thanks. But I need to see your corporate logo as well. For identification purposes.
116716	My superiors at the Global Union had reservations about you. But I've convinced them. They even decided to allocate you high-grade territory for new corporate headquarters. Choose a sector.
116717	Almost there. We just have to negotiate the terms of your contract with Global Union. Funding conditions and the like.
116718	Oh, you want to look into the contract details. Any specific paragraphs you have in mind?
116719	And we're through. Already wasted enough time on paperwork. Let's enter your new territory and start with Phase 1 of the program. Details please, A.D.A.M.
117484	Rafferty, please come in! Rafferty!
117485	Good. Start the test run!
117207	The spaceport building side off the coast is still unstaffed. But as soon as you've built the necessary housing, your construction team will be moving in.
117213	Organic food is perceived as needless luxury by many MegaCorps. Good to see you share the Union's perspective.
117209	Great. Building material shortages shouldn't be an issue anymore!
117211	Your construction crew is one of the first ready. Keep up the pace! Your competitors will try to catch up.
117212	For the next construction stage, you'll need qualified ground staff to operate the spaceport. Make sure to adhere to Union standards, while providing the required infrastructure.
117208	You need this desalination plant. These days it's the only way to come by drinkable water.
117479	A broad range of information services. This will enable your employees to develop their interests as well as their skills.
117214	One thing I learned during my political career: Prosperity and competence springs from happiness. You've taken heed of that.
117215	Remarkable progress. You've assembled construction crews and ground personnel faster than I was expecting. You are more than ready for the first major hurdle.
117216	The program demands you to connect your city with the Global Union space station via a space elevator. So far only MegaCorps like the Big Five use such technology. But I'm sure you have the same potential!
117217	Good. You've gathered the components needed for the elevator. Only the elevator cable requires special materials you can't produce. But I arranged for a delivery.
117218	A clever move, seeing to your staff's good health. Benefits like that make you more attractive an employer.
117219	Your technicians are ready! Start the elevator construction once all other requirements are met. My associate John Rafferty is already heading here with the special material deliveries.
117480	Alright, no time to study regulations! Meet Rafferty at the coordinates transmitted! Do whatever is necessary!
117481	I'm glad you come back unharmed. This attack gave everyone at the Union headquarters shock. But the program has to go on!
117482	We've lost contact to Lunar Excavation Corp. It seems many moon colonies aligned with the Orbital Watch! It's all the more important your space elevator goes into operation!
117483	Congratulations! The first step into space! All purviews of the global economy are now accessible for you. Phase 2 of the Lunar Licensing Program starts now!
117544	Outstanding! Now we can start the expansion of... wait, what's...
117486	In the Arctic, all your actions will fall under the supervision of the Arctic Custodians. Let's have a look at their territory.
117487	It was a diplomatic feat to make the Custodians open their lands for private corporations. So your choice of location is somewhat limited.
117488	Good. Let's send your Arctic expedition on the way then. But please make sure you stay within the designated settlement zones.
117489	Not exactly a warm welcome. But let's just proceed with Phase 2. We need Arctic resources for rocket construction, so we have to establish a base of operations on one of these islands.
117490	Set up your new location wherever you want. All of the islands are suitable.
117491	If you build a Distribution Center here, I can officially sign the island over to you.
117492	With the acquisition of this island you earned the mining rights for this area. The Arctic Custodians will watch you like a hawk from now on.
117493	Their directives are strict. But you should adhere to them while building up your basic infrastructure. The heating standards alone will be a challenge.
117494	Your production facilities give off enough warmth to heat your entire settlement. But without insulation materials, the effect would evaporate.
117495	I've never eaten real fish in my life. The polar regions are the only places on Earth where you still can find it in harvestable quantities.
117497	Well, that's exactly what's on the agenda right now. The Orbital Watch is still threatening the Union trade routes. You have to establish your own shipping docks at the spaceport.
117498	Great! Our control and communication systems in space will be operated with these interfaces.
117499	Your arctic settlement is growing at a steady pace. The staff requirements for your spaceport's shipping docks should be met by now.
117500	Jorgensen is right! We have to interfere, official admission or not! Enact a hacking counterattack against the Orbital Watch's jamming stations! Or destroy them, if you must!
117501	You're back? Now how's the status?
117502	Our hackers are at their consoles! A.D.A.M., connect us to the Climate Stabilizer network!
117503	So, did it work?
117504	And I'm sure we haven't seen the last of them. But the Global Union will not give in to Drake's demands. The Lunar Licensing Program must continue.
117505	The Orbital Watch presents a greater threat than we thought. Drake must have secret supporters. It's essential the Union shows a strong presence on the Moon.
117506	And to make this possible, we need you to send a fleet of colony shuttles up there. Time to conduct some space technology research.
117507	Being exposed to those freezing temperatures all day... your arctic staff will sure appreciate the extra vitamins.
117508	In times like these, it's important that people move closer together. Especially with terrorism at our very doorstep.
117509	Excellent. Your arctic community is provided with everything. Go ahead and recruit a research team.
117511	The blueprints do look promissing. But I spoke with John Rafferty and there are some practical issues.
117512	The production is running? Good. Besides launch pad and shuttle construction, metal like this has many other applications.
117513	Phase 3 is within reach. But coordinating all the different branches of your space program will be a tremendous task. You will have to delegate some responsibilities, like it or not.
117514	Swift data processing is essential for your ground staff. Good thing you've planned ahead.
117515	One step closer to immortality. And I'm not referring to the miracle drug you've developed. You will live on through your deeds.
117516	Security controls. Essential in our spaceport. Even more so when you're dealing with terrorists of the Orbital Watch's caliber.
117517	Great! Everything is going according to schedule! Not long before you cross the final frontier, so to speak.
117518	I hear, John Rafferty is already reviewing the plans for the launch ramps. Let's complete the final stages and make those plans a reality.
117519	You heard the man! The systems are ready and the shuttles are in position! Just start the countdown.
117520	A historic moment! The eyes of the world are upon you! Phase 3 has begun! The Second Wave heads for the Moon!
117619	Oh, no... could... could this?
117620	The Orbital Watch, for sure! Stay on your guard!
117622	Just got the word! The Orbital Watch... they're taking concerted actions all over the globe. Attacking the Union's energy grid. And their weapons... We've never seen something like that!
117623	It's way off the official procedures. But I activated an... old contact of mine. If anyone can find out what's really going on, it's her.
117624	Here and now, it all converges. All your efforts, all your sacrifices.
117625	It's finished! Phase 3... finished! Sorry, I have to... collect myself. A.D.A.M. can you take over?
117626	Congratulation! Phase 3 of the Lunar Licensing Program is finished. But one last point remains on the project plan. And that is to thank you! For all you've done for humanity! You're the forerunner of a new era of prosperity!
117546	You came a long way. But there's still another 250 000 miles to cross for you. Your colonists are waiting for orders.
117547	And be careful. As far as we know the Orbital Watch has overtaken most of the LEC's colonies. Up there, you will be on your own.
117554	Safety requirements demand you only found moon colonies in craters. They offer the best protection against cosmic radiation and meteor impacts.
117555	Don't let him upset you. Drake is dangerous, no question. But you've proven you can cope with him.
117557	The Moon has no atmosphere. Even the tiniest meteor particles could do tremendous damage to your colony. Energy shields prevent that.
117558	Your colonies are under a lot of pressure. Quite literally. Only the toughest materials qualify for space structures.
117559	Oxygen facilities. The most critical component to your astronauts very survival.
117560	It's official. This sector holds the first colony to meet the standards of the Lunar Licensing Program. No cause for complaints.
117561	Don't leave our good old Earth out of the picture, though. To send your lunar yield down, you must establish additional landing stages for cargo shuttles.
117562	It's amazing how big your colony has grown in such a short time.
117563	The human body is not fit for zero gravity exposure. Good thing your biotech division found a way to reduce health risks for your astronauts.
117565	Excellent. Soon Earth and Moon won't feel so far apart anymore.
117564	Listen. I was told to keep this confidential. But you see, LEC fugitives secretly fled to Earth... The Global Union didn't find a proper solution. So they transferred them to Arctic protectorates.
117566	And now I've been informed, that Drake is leading a battlefleet there to annihilate them. Please, you must step in.
117567	The fugitives are safe. But Drake's fleet, his dreadnoughts... These aren't mere mercenaries. Drake must have military facilities on Earth.
117568	Thank you. With a big corporation like yours backing them, the Custodians could set-up defensive works. For now, they were able to stop Drake's ships and protect the fugitives.
117569	The landing stages are ready to accept cargo shuttles. Now you can establish interorbital transportation routes.
117570	But that doesn't mean your colony is safe. The supply lines from Earth are easy targets. I'd recommend you make your colony as self-sustaining and independent as possible.
117571	Up here, your colonists are constantly exposed to cosmic radiation. Their spacesuits fend off some of it. The rest is neutralized by potent medicine like this.
117572	Living on the Moon is like living in a fishbowl. One small leak and conditions become hostile. But you're prepared.
117573	You must have tried the... food here as well. I'm glad you're not expecting your colonists to live off nothing but pap from tubes.
117574	A self-contained lunar community. In the beginning it was only small steps. But now you stand firmly and your colony has taken roots.
117575	You're ready to get to the core of the Lunar Licensing Program: Fusion energy generation. It's all theory, still. But I believe in you.
117576	Deuterium. One of the basic elements of fusion power generation. But don't ask me how this all works. That's what your Scientists are for.
117577	Things are progressing. The first deuterium deliveries just entered the lunar orbit.
117578	Helium-3. The fuel of the future. So far it's potential hasn't been tapped. But that's about to change.
117580	Fusion power cells. The batteries of tomorrow! Put them in a Fusion Reactor and energy concern will be passé.
117581	This all looks promissing. I must say I'm a little wired up right now.
117582	It works! It really works! You've just created a clean supply of infinite energy! This will catapult humanity into a new era!
117583	Now, share your achievements with the world! The Global Union wants you to build the two most powerful energy transmitters ever seen.
117584	This will be the most difficult construction project you have undergone so far. But judging from your employees motivation, you've bright prospects.
117585	Great! Your engineers will need tons of these materials to build the energy transmitters.
117586	The fusion reactors are connected, the satellites are calibrated. On this side of the orbit, everything is ready for power transmission.
117587	Putting up its counterpart on Earth will be even more of a challenge. Looking at the Lunar Licensing Program funding, better see that you have enough investors on board.
117588	And that's only one part of the challenge. Looking at the Lunar Licensing Program funds, I say you better see that you have enough investors on board.
117589	I knew it would be a mammoth project. But seeing thousands of people work towards a sole goal, across the orbit... just incredible.
117590	Bioenhancement is the latest thing on Earth. And it really adds to mankind's diversity. It's fascinating how our idea of beauty can change at a whim.
117591	One outfit for all occassions. At will it alters its texture, thickness, color, style... The future is now, indeed.
117592	Meat? From real animals? Well, there will be people who view this as a luxury. But others will see it as overly decadent.
117594	Oh yes, this will decongest the Aeromobile traffic a little. The skylanes are way too crowded as it is.
117595	I see, you've won enough investors over to your cause. The funding of your new energy transmission project should be taken care of now.
117597	You're making headway. That's good. The successful start of the transmitters will decide if the Lunar Licensing Program lives up to the hopes put in it.
117599	She will call in a return for her services one day. But what matters is, you dealt Drake a heavy blow. He will recover from it, no doubt. But for now, we have the advantage. And we should use it!
117600	The lack of reliable energy sources is Earth's greatest weakness. Especially in conflicted times like ours. But you hold the key for a peaceful future. The Lunar Licensing Program is about to be completed.
117601	One last point remains on my project plan. And that is to thank you! For all you've done for humanity! You're the forerunner of a new era of prosperity!
119697	Each one of Virgil Drake's schemes you stop brings us closer to a peaceful colonization of the Moon. Keep it up.
119698	Just got the word! The Orbital Watch ... they're taking concerted actions all over the globe. Attacking the Union's energy grid. But I activated an ... old contact of mine. If anyone can find out what's really going on, it's her.
117627	The Union has great plans! Your corporation will become the government-accredited provider of lunar resources. And as a sign of gratitude, you're given building permits for a corporate headquarter of your choice.
117628	Your stocks are going through the roof! Every financier on Earth has to consider putting his money into your company. They would be shortsighted if they didn't.
117629	A device reassembling material at will. Technology like this would not have been possible, if you hadn't provided us an infinite source of energy.
117630	Human-like robots will raise the living standard on Earth considerably. And they can work in areas hostile to life. Outer space for example.
117631	Incredible! These computers... we can't even estimate their full potential yet. But they will be indispensable for humanity's future projects.
117632	This technology is small-scale now. But if you think it big... it could empower humanity to travel great distances through space.
117633	A true architectural marvel! No longer can there be a doubt. The Big Five are history. Now, we have to speak of the Big Six!
117634	But I've known long enough to say, that this isn't the end of the road for you. I'm sure you already have plans how to surpass yourself even more!
117635	You always go the extra mile. That's why your competitors are so far behind you. And that's why we want you for our next project!
117636	Great! You always seek to rise for new heights! And soon you will have the opportunity to travel to even higher spheres, so to speak!
117637	Marvellous! I'd call it the 8th wonder of the world, but that would fall short.
117638	You are the limit! When I first met you, I already knew you would go places. And indeed, you went to the Moon and back. In all sincerity: I feel honored having worked with you! And I'm looking forward for the things that are to come!
117641	Drake! Whenever you think you have a moment to catch a breath, he creeps out of his lair. But I've had it with all the hide and seek. It's time to strike back.
117642	Drake! If you think you have a moment to catch a breath... I got word he's sending his battleships all over the globe. They use devastating weapons, like we've never seen them.
117643	It's way off the official procedures. But I activated an... old contact of mine. If anyone can find out where Drake hides, it's her.
117644	It's way off the official procedures. But I activated an... old contact of mine. She knows where Drake is hiding. And she's willing to infiltrate his facilities, to find out what he's planning.
117645	She will call in a return for her services one day. But what matters is, you've pulled Drake's claws. He will recover from it, no doubt. But for now, our people on Earth and on the Moon can have peace of mind.
117646	And you don't have to worry about the Orbital Watch messing with your projects. I'm sure you've already planned how to crown your previous achievements.
115978	We need your assistance! Privateers have hijacked our cargo ships in this sector! Please, don't hesitate.
115979	The attackers came out of nowhere. We have to make sure that the crews of our ships remain safe! Secure this sector!
115980	Transports have been hijacked in this sector. Rescuing them is your number one priority!
115981	Extremists have brought this sector under their control! We will have to act carefully, if we want to take it back!
115982	Don't let your guard down. Hostile ships patrol these waters. But it's critical we reclaim this sector.
115983	These radicals are a menace to international peace. You are given permission to stop them by all means necessary.
115987	You alleviated the situation. Thank you.
115988	Well done! You found the appropriate response to this threat!
115989	You prevented the situation from escalating further. Thank you.
115993	You had to pull back. Anything else would have been unwise.
115994	Your strategic withdrawl was the right decision. Nothing more we can do now.
115995	Unfortunately, sometimes defense is better than offense.
115996	Please, don't waste time! The people on those ships are depending on you!
115997	That wasn't the last of the seized ships. Don't let the others down!
115998	This one is free. But these extremists are threatening even more ships.
115999	You have my support in what is to come.
116000	We need to press onward.
116001	Let's not wait too long. The situation demands your intervention.
116229	We've detected valuable goods.
116230	These will be of use to you.
116234	Reel these in.
116256	Don't hesitate!
116257	Time to engage them.
116258	There they are!
116259	Only one course of action.
116260	This is my advice.
116261	I've transmitted information.
111021	Great!
111022	An unprecedented success.
111023	A resounding success!
111024	I'm sure that will prove popular.
111025	Outstanding performance!
111026	Good job!
111027	A total success!
111028	Groundbreaking!
111029	I'm impressed!
111030	There just aren't enough words.
111031	I'm happy that's not a factor anymore.
111032	Good. Nothing left to impede our progress now.
111033	I'm pleased to see the end of this matter, once and for all.
111034	You're an inspiration to us all!
111037	Your dedication is unrivalled!
111038	You surprise me, again and again.
111039	That's why I brought you into the Program!
111040	Many owe you a vote of thanks!
111042	That will win you high praise. And rightly so.
111043	We're honored by your dedication.
111045	So this will continue to preoccupy us.
111046	Well, things can only get better from here on in.
111047	That's a setback.
111049	Today's a black day.
111050	There's nothing to sugarcoat.
111052	Of all things...
111053	[Sigh] That is bad news.
111054	I never advised you to do that.
111055	Please, don't tell me that was your idea.
111057	That's something you can't simply explain away.
111058	You really considered this necessary?
111059	You know, this will become highly political.
111060	Let's face the facts. You messed up.
111062	Look at it this way, at least there'll be other projects.
111063	Can I be honest? That wasn't your best decision.
111064	Welcome to the central office.
111065	Yes? Is there something you wanted to ask?
111066	Come in and have a look at the current directives.
111067	Of course I can spare some time.
111068	Oh, hello. Is there something we need to discuss?
111069	Welcome. Do you need some information?
111070	Did you want to bring something to our attention?
111072	Please direct your attention to this.
111073	Always good to see you.
111074	Thanks for conferring with me.
111075	I'll get everything started.
111076	I'll delegate that matter.
111077	Certainly.
111078	I'll push it through.
111079	I'll make every effort.
111080	You can count on me.
111081	Let me take care of that for you.
111082	I'm grateful for your trust.
111083	You can consider it done.
111084	I won't let you down.
111086	I'm afraid my hands are tied.
111087	That's above my paygrade.
111088	I'm afraid I'm not allowed to.
111089	Our directives forbid me to interfere in such matters.
111090	Too many of our stakeholders are not fully convinced.
111091	I cannot bend the rules for you in this case.
111092	Sorry, you'll have to do without me this time.
111093	I appreciate your trust, but you overestimate my influence.
111094	I'm sorry, but I can't give you preference in such matters.
111095	I was told not to support you in this.
111096	We'd like to close the file on this matter.
111097	I took the liberty of recommending you for this project.
111098	We need your help.
111099	We have a request. Nothing you can't do.
111100	The Ministry voted on it. They didn't want anyone else to do the job!
111101	We're seeking reliable partners. How about you?
111102	An official request. Only if your time allows.
111103	What do you think? Can we still fit this into your schedule?
111104	Many thanks! That was a great help.
111105	I can always count on you, that's for sure.
111106	Without a hitch. You are exceptional!
111107	This only proves once more why I selected you for the program!
111108	My friends in the company are over the Moon!
111109	As I thought. You know how to handle situations like that.
111110	If only things went this efficiently in the Senate.
111111	You deserve my heartfelt thanks!
111112	The best-laid plans often go astray, so it's said.
111113	We speak of "insurmountable difficulties" in a case like this.
111114	I'm afraid a lot of confidence has been lost.
111139	Many were relying on you.
111140	I'm sure you have your reasons.
111141	I understand. The time isn't right.
111115	So, how much progress have you made?
111116	Are we still on track?
111117	I don't want to rush you, but...
111119	Let me know when you're ready.
111120	I'm sure everything is going according to plan, right?
111121	The people in my company are on edge as it is.
111122	Any new developments?
111123	That is what was requested.
111124	According to the order form, this is relevant for us.
111125	You found it!
111126	Yes, this is part of the assignment.
111127	Everything is where you suspected it would be...
111128	There it is.
111129	You spotted it.
111130	Well. You certainly had no difficulties finding that.
111131	Yes, that's the location.
111133	Yes, that's the location specified.
111134	Exactly, this is where you have to go.
111135	You're on the right track.
111136	Don't wait too long to go there.
111137	Are you ready to head over there?
111138	Shouldn't take too long to reach this spot.
111142	Great! But things have gotten a bit complicated...
111143	That's phase 1 completed. Now on to phase 2.
111144	Thanks! But I'm afraid that's not the end of it...
111146	My superiors are impressed. They have an immediate follow-up assignment for you.
111147	We have authorized you to take military action.
111148	Global Union gave the green light. You have to intervene out there!
111149	Let's hope for the best. But when dealing with the Orbital Watch we should prepare for the worst.
111150	I'm afraid it's time for the ugly side of politics.
111151	The Global Union demands you demonstrate a strong presence out there!
111152	You did what had to be done. Thanks.
111153	I'm glad you averted the worst.
111154	That was very courageous of you.
115984	All of the ships are safe. Thank you for your courageous intervention!
115985	Thank you. The crews and cargo are back to safety.
115986	Just in time! Who knows what they would have done with our ships!
111155	So many lives...
111156	I'm glad you're OK at least. That could have ended differently.
111157	I think we have to boost our military budget even more.
115990	Their control over the ships was too great. You did what you could.
115991	A regrettable conclusion to a rescue mission. I wonder if we could've done more.
115992	We have to face the facts. Those ships are lost.
111231	Aidan would've been ousted long ago, if it weren't for your constant help.
111232	Be careful of doing too much business with Cassian! Maybe the upcoming merger they're constantly talking of involves your corporation.
111227	Have you ever spoken to this mysterious superior Aidan keeps mentioning? Acting through intermediaries seems to be Cassian's way of avoiding any liabilities.
111228	I don't think Aidan has the power to make many decisions on his own. That might help you avoid any Cassian interference in your business.
111229	Cassian Industries has big ambitions for the Moon. They could become your foremost rivals for the mining grounds there.
111230	Cassian Industries is known for its ruthless business policies. Stay on your guard.
111225	Cassian Industries is the world's foremost provider of mining and heavy industry services. Cooperation could be beneficial.
111226	Cassian Industries is known for dismissing employees when they become difficult. I hope it's not the same with business partners.
111223	Ibarra-FoxCom claims to be the technology experts. Yet they always turn to you in the end.
111224	You're always at the front of the line for Hofwegen's tests. But as long as it gets you results...
111219	I hope Dr. Hofwegen lives up to her title. Don't let her burn your assets for some daydreams.
111220	Dr. Hofwegen certainly is enthusiastic about her field. Channel that enthusiasm to where it benefits your corporation most.
111221	You'd better stay away from Hofwegen's unauthorized field studies. They could potentially hurt your reputation.
111222	Smart move! You've benefited enormously from Ibarra-FoxCom's projects.
111217	Dr. Hofwegen is a genius in applied robotics. Working with her won't hurt.
111218	Ibarra-FoxCom... A big name in robotics and bio-computers. And now they know your corporation as well.
111215	Rafferty is quite the do-it-yourself kind of guy. But he seems to trust you.
111216	Rafferty occasionally has some strange ideas. But he also has you to make them reality.
111211	And here I thought Rafferty mostly kept to himself. Thought wrong, obviously.
111212	I can't help it, I like that old guy.
111213	Another assignment from Rafferty? I'm sure the Union refused it before he came to you.
111214	You've helped Rafferty a great deal recently. I hope he at least thanks you.
111209	And he didn't even yell at you. He must be in a good mood.
111210	Believe me, if Rafferty asks for something, he's in real trouble.
111207	I'm curious. In all the time you worked together... Did you ever get her real name?
111208	Whatever her agenda... I'm sure you helped her out.
111203	That's quite a few commitments you made to her. Stay on your guard.
111204	When she offers us an Assignment, I always have the feeling she's not telling the whole story.
111205	I hope she hasn't learned too much about your company already.
111206	It's not that I don't trust her. I just don't know what she's capable of.
111201	I know, her offers are inviting. But you should be careful around her.
111202	It's true, sometimes you have to turn to the fringes to get something done.
111199	Seeing you defy the Orbital Watch so often... I truly believe the Moon will be safe one day.
111200	Virgil Drake must be infuriated at all your accomplishments. I like that idea. I really do.
111195	The Orbital Watch is a danger to global peace. I'm glad you're dealing with this problem.
111196	Virgil Drake is a dangerous man. But you'll put him in his place.
111197	Each time you stop one of Virgil Drake's schemes you bring us closer to a peaceful colonization of the Moon. Keep it up!
111198	Keep it up! Let justice prevail!
111193	I see. You've decided to go head-to-head with the Orbital Watch.
111194	Very good! Show Virgil Drake he doesn't have free rein here.
111183	After all your help you must have improved the lives of countless LEC survivors.
111184	Be careful! Drake must be furious, after seeing how well you and Zandra have cooperated so far.
111179	She's hunted and destitute, and yet she still manages to give something back for our help. One more reason to support her.
111180	If your actions helped at least a few of the LEC survivors it was well worth it.
111181	This woman is surrounded by enemies, but just keeps going. She'll be a valuable ally in the conflicts to come.
111182	We shouldn't give up on the LEC just yet. Zandra and her survivors will have to rely on you for support.
111177	I appreciate your decision. It's true, the fugitives must be helped.
111178	Zandra Haynes is our best chance to stay ahead of the Orbital Watch. We should stay in touch.
111175	I wonder, after all your deals with Jorgensen... Did his business even grow?
111176	You have to hand it to Jorgensen... without him, the colonization of the Arctic would have been much more difficult.
111171	Jorgensen's idea of regular transport routes between the temperate and polar regions... I think it's worth supporting.
111172	I like Jorgensen. He's... well, he's easy to deal with.
111173	Bringing trade and commerce to the polar region. Jorgensen will be dependent on your support in this endeavour.
111174	Jorgensen sure isn't popular with his own people. I hope that doesn't reflect badly on us.
111169	Good to know we have one supporter in this area, right?
111170	An Arctic wholesaler? His cooperation could prove profitable.
111167	So you decided to keep working with Papadakis. Well, don't say I didn't warn you.
111168	I get it. I'll keep my nose out of your business with Papadakis from now on.
111161	I can't always cover up your... little deals with Papadakis. You know that.
111162	My superiors are starting to ask questions about you and Papadakis.
111163	Be careful, your dealings with Papadakis could get us in to hot water.
111160	Papadakis could be trouble. You should be careful.
111233	Buhari seems be very professional. You're right about checking the possibilities for cooperation.
111234	Saayman is the world's biggest food supplier. I'm sure we will have more to do with them in the future.
111235	Saayman is a company with a very political agenda. Don't allow them to exploit you.
111237	Saayman is a very powerful company, so helping them reflects positively on you.
111241	Lei Sheng is the leading international energy supplier. No wonder they're making advances to the competition.
111244	Be careful. I'm sure Lei Sheng has reasons for working so closely with us.
111245	It seems to be true that Lei Sheng's star is waning. Why else would they outsource so many projects?
111246	May Tian, of course! She used to work for a number of intelligence services. Beware of corporate espionage.
111247	One thing is certain, Lei Sheng needs us to get their business straight. This may be useful one day.
111248	Well, if Tian really is spying on us, at least you had a good look into her company as well.
111249	Usoyev Incorporated is the old pro of the chemicals industry. They will be a valuable partner.
111252	Believe me, Volodin knows just how to handle people. Don't mistake his friendliness for altruism.
111254	You have a good rapport with Usoyev. But don't let them take advantage of you.
111255	So many joint projects with a company that's been around for so long... That just goes to show that you can even cope with the Big Five.
115446	A cold fish. But I'm glad you haven't given up diplomatic efforts.
115447	The Arctic Custodians keep our planet habitable. They deserve our support.
115449	Dr. Young offers your corporation more and more Assignments. He seems to be thawing!
115450	The Custodians are withdrawn, yes. But they never forget a favor.
115451	You should keep in Dr. Young's good books. It'll help you gain a better foothold here.
115452	Dr. Young is the loudest critic of privatization in the Arctic. But thanks to you, he seems to be starting to recognize the benefits.
115454	He doesn't show it, but I'm sure Dr. Young is grateful for all the things you did.
115455	Your helpfulness has brought us closer to the Custodians than politics ever could.
116762	So, an agent of the Big Five approached you. Not surprising. The Big Five are the most influential corporations on Earth. And you are at the forefront of the Lunar Licensing Program. Don't let them fleece you.
116761	So, an agent of the Big Five approached you. Not surprising. The Big Five are the most influential corporations on Earth. But they're exempt from the Lunar Licensing Program. Don't let them fleece you.
111257	They got you! Call the mission off!
111258	And you were so careful... too bad.
111259	Maybe we should have approached them in the open right away.
111260	You seem to be getting close.
111261	It should be somewhere around here.
111262	I'm sure it's not far away.
111263	Very good! You found it!
111264	This must be what we're after.
111265	You have an good eye.
111266	May I make a suggestion? I think we should proceed as follows...
111267	I have some clarifying information for you...
111268	Our protocol calls for the following in cases like this...
111269	Now let's talk about the next few steps...
111270	I hope this helps you.
111271	See? It's working now...
111272	Good. We should keep this procedure in mind in future.
111273	Very good. We should standardize the process.
111274	A consignment from your asteroid mining drones.
111275	External delivery. Just came in from the asteroid belt.
111276	It seems your asteroid mining operation is making a profit.
111277	No doubt about it, your company has a bright future!
111278	The competition had better keep an eye on you!
111279	I'm convinced. Your company will be one of the pioneers of the Space Age.
111280	Congratulations on such a rapid rise!
111281	Your rapid increase in importance should be a warning to the Big Five!
111282	Your corporation just keeps growing! The Big Five can't ignore this much longer.
111283	You'll be one of this century's most remembered faces!
111284	I must say, your progress is remarkable.
111285	My superiors are truly impressed by your accomplishments. So am I.
111286	An ideal location for the next branch office. Well chosen!
111287	Make sure everything that happens on your new island conforms to regulations.
111288	Paperwork's done. It's yours!
111289	Very good! The Custodians already gave you clearance!
111290	Good thinking! Another arctic branch office will certainly prove useful.
111291	Of all the chunks of ice out here I would have chosen this one, too.
111292	The Big Five are reaching for the Moon. And you're leading the way!
111293	Good thinking, making room now for more colonists.
111294	Approved. This crater is officially yours.
111295	Your finances are in free fall. Time to act.
111296	Our shareholders are getting nervous about your financial status.
111297	Our guidelines recommend radical cuts during a financial crisis like this.
111298	Your request for another loan was declined. You must act now...
111299	You're running your business way into the red, here...
111300	If you don't do something right now, your corporation will go broke! Understand me? Broke!
111301	Time is running out. You have to improve your financial situation right away!
111302	Your reserves are nearly depleted! If you don't do something immediately, you'll go broke.
111303	We've granted you additional resources. Please use them sparingly.
111304	Our investors want to keep your project going. In spite of your financial difficulties.
111305	Don't ask me how I arranged this, but you will be granted a special loan.
111306	Official funding. Let's hope it's enough to rebalance the books.
111308	You have your finances well in hand after all.
111309	I told them not to write you off prematurely!
111310	The fact you managed to turn this around gives me new hope.
111311	No one should doubt your foresight.
111312	Back in the black. No one should have doubted your financial expertise.
111313	Even back in college, I wanted to work in politics. I just wanted to leave my mark on the world, make peoples' lives better... Well, in hindsight I should have joined a private enterprise to fulfill these goals.
111314	This space program regulations catalog is so overcomplicated... don't get me started.
111315	Everyone claims the Big Five don't have a political agenda. But when you see how they lobby our committees, I find that hard to believe.
111316	The Lunar Licensing Program? Likely the most far-sighted program of all time. And it only took 16 years to be implemented…
111317	Me? Well, there's not much to say. I go quad biking, I like dogs and those old 2D movies, rats are gross and... wait, are you taking notes?
117674	Streets... well, there are streets for many reasons. First there's the magnetic inductors keeping the Aeromobiles in the air. But more importantly, the conservative parties in the Union don't want them to be done away with.
111318	It was only a matter of time before the LEC lost their monopoly. Lunar resources are simply too important these days…
111319	My employer? They're great, really... ah, okay. Between us, I have the feeling I've been sidelined here. But why complain, it gave me the chance to work with you.
111320	Working as a representative for the Orbital Affairs Ministry... I remember times when you were laughed at just for mentioning it. But now, with the Lunar Licensing Program, the job has become a lot more prestigious. And influential.
111321	We support the Arctic Custodians in their duties as protectors of the climate. But the diplomatic wrangling needed to get them to open their territories to us... you have no idea!
111322	The world moves faster and faster every day. Sometimes you have to take a moment and quietly look at what you've accomplished. Like... the amazing skyline built in your name.
111323	And so time goes by. I wish your corporation a prosperous new year. May all your projects pay off.
111324	The year is still young and you're already back in the office. That's dedication!
111326	A spooky Halloween to you! I hope you don't mind me not wearing a costume.
111327	I don't know if you celebrate them, but just in case... Happy holidays!
111328	Happy Easter. And no, I didn't hide any baskets in the head office.
111329	I would like to cordially congratulate you on your birthday! All the best wishes!
115464	Now your corporation has grown, you've been invited to take part in the upcoming global industry summits.
116604	I'm sure you have many questions. If you want more information on the assignments or practices of the Lunar Licensing Program, just come to the Global Union headquarters.
117532	Welcome to the Global Union headquarters. I've compiled you an overview on all the tasks and requirements of the space program. Have a look if you like.
117533	All the building options, production sequences, staff requests... that can be overwhelming. But A.D.A.M. operates a database, where you can access all relevant information on these things.
117534	The Global Union files video footage from all the major steps of the Lunar Licensing Program. It's all accessible from here.
116818	You didn't tell me you're investing in an asteroid mining project. Very foresightful. The first delivery already came in.
117522	A new delivery from your asteroid mines is here. I had it transferred to your storage.
117523	This just came in from your asteroid mining facilities.
117524	Cargo shuttles from your asteroid mines have arrived. I hope it is a good yield.
117525	Another delivery from your asteroid mines. It's already unloaded.
117526	Your asteroid miners brought in a few cargo containers. They were send to your storage.
117527	On part of the Global Union, you're free to expand into other sectors. It might be about time.
117528	Your corporation is growing at a steady pace. You should consider expanding into other sectors.
117529	Some of your rivals have financial problems in their sectors. Maybe you can renegotiate the usage rights, if you get my drift.
117530	Opening locations in additional sectors will improve your prospects on the market. Think about it.
117531	Even the richest corporations have to part from their sectors sometimes, to remain in the black. You shouldn't miss those opportunities.
117655	You're becoming a global player. You should think about expansion. I'm positive some of your competitors will leave their sectors to you, if you pay them off.
117656	Congratulations on your new territory. I don't know if you registered this sector takeover properly. But we don't have to be that exact, right?
116603	Oh, I see you have obtained a few tons of rare materials. Those are essential for setting up an advanced modular industry. Put them to good use in your production facilities.
117657	It's advisable you keep your production machinery up to date. Industrial modules are the leading edge currently.
117658	To cope with the competition, you must optimize your production processes. Modules are a great way to do that!
117659	In the industry, it's all about optimization. Modules can help keep costs low and productivity high.
116605	Before I forget, I persuaded my superiors to assign you a ship from the Global Union fleet. It awaits your orders.
116758	Your corporation's influence is undeniable. The Global Union grants you elective franchise at the upcoming global industry summit. Your vote could change the future of the economy.
117141	This spot here is perfectly suited to support a bridge to the other side. Building one here will give you access to new construction ground.
117660	Good news! You have the official permit of the Global Union to build bridges at designated spots.
117661	Your command ship. Officially for Lunar Licensing Program tasks only. But if you use it for your own business assignments too, I won't be hypercritical.
117675	Very well. Help others to help yourself. Business assignments can be very profitable in terms of materials and resources.
116606	Good, you have bought yourself some time. Now straighten your balance out.
116609	Bankruptcy is avoided for now. But you still have to bring your balance into line.
116610	Your finances seem to be recovering. That's a start.
117138	This requires your attention.
117139	This is important. Please have a look at it.
117140	Please, direct your attention here for a moment.
117142	You did have the best intentions, but you're well on your way to bankrupcy again.
117143	Your creditors are unimpressed by your measures. Your insolvency is under discussion again.
117639	If you meant to get back into the black by that, I'm afraid you achieved the contrary.
117662	I thought you'd regain your feet. But you're again threatened by the liquidator!
117188	You have change requests?
117189	Oh, I shall adjust something?
117190	I know. All those forms. Errors happen.
117191	It's just paperwork, really. Nothing to ponder over long.
117192	Going through everything, yes? Alright, I won't rush you.
117193	Don't want to be rude, but we have a tight schedule.
117593	I can't fail to be impressed. Even the mighty Big Five are just small fry for you. The world economy is firmly in your hands.
117647	It wasn't only a great year for Global Union, but for all humanity.
117648	Ladies and Gentlemen, I think we all agree. The Orbital Watch is still a thread for the free world!
117649	Believe me, the Global Union is working on a solution for the LEC fugitive situation.
117650	Everyone, I thank you for your participation in the Lunar Licensing Program!
117651	I may not give away any details, Lauren. The new program is still under tight wraps.
117652	Yes, we will continue to work together with this corporation.
117653	If my party backs me up, I might be standing for election. I'm considering it.
117654	This is Hawk1! Position is 4.17, 8.25! Preparing for touchdown!
117663	I tried everything, but my superiors decided not to take any more risks. I'm sorry, but I have to revoke your participation in the Lunar Licensing Program.
117664	I'm sorry. But the risks are simply too high. I fear your corporation would fail with the pressure of the Lunar Licensing Program on it. I have no other choice but to revoke your participation.
117665	I know, it's a lot of things to keep in mind. But A.D.A.M. compiled you a database where you can access all the information you need.
117666	No energy, no industry. At the moment, you're not providing enough.
117667	Your facilities are consuming more energy than you are providing. This reduces their productivity.
117668	Your industry suffers from a shortage of workforce. This impairs productivity.
117669	Your logistics network doesn't meet the demands of your industry. Your facilities are less productive that way.
117670	You should consider investing in modular industry facilities. Give it a try.
117671	As I see it, your residents aren't satisfied with their life here. Give them material incentives.
117672	Heating is a big topic here in the Arctic. Put your residents' homes near production facilities. They give off warmth.
117673	Meteor impacts are a constant thread for your lunar population. Build shield generators to protect them.
115384	We're ready to proceed. Just say the word.
115385	Alright. You can take over again.
115386	Patience pays. Everything is prepared for the next phase.
115387	I have a golden opportunity for you. Don't pass it up.
115388	You are being asked for your support. I await your answer.
115389	There are great plans for this sector. Contact me for details!
115779	More than ever there are challenges to be faced in this era. What the people need right now is a confident, steadfast leader. And you can help us convey that message.
115780	We want to commemorate the First Wave taking place a century ago. With the Lunar Licensing Program starting, what better time is there to remind humanity of its potential?
115781	Building a breathtaking monument is a tremendous responsibility. Beaumont already speaks highly of you and when you're done, I'm sure everyone else will, too.
115782	Good day to you. Work has started on a project that will lead the way for generations to come. Will you rise to the occasion?
115783	I knew my trust wasn't misplaced. This is a wise long-term investment, and I'm excited to see how it pays off once the construction has been concluded.
115784	The foundation is looking good already. If you'll excuse me, I'll be preparing the next phase. You'll be hearing from me.
115785	Bad news. I am needed elsewhere.
115786	I'll contact you when time allows. Now, if you'll excuse me.
115787	Truly a testament to resilience and longevity! I thank you for your cooperation. This is badly needed publicity.
115788	The monument has definitely become a landmark. The Lunar Licensing Program's popularity has skyrocketed!
115647	Sorry, but I'm short on time. Anthony Goodwin. Secretary of Pan-Terrestial Commerce. It's my duty to inform you that your company is now listed on the world markets. Come to my office and we'll talk details.
115648	Welcome to the center of global commerce. As a registered company, you may directly import and export goods at the current world market values.
115706	Your corporation's value is not to be underated. Make your presence felt on the world markets.
115716	There are many opportunities to be seized on the world markets. Do not miss them.
115717	A CEO such as yourself should show their presence on the world markets every now and again.
115725	Import and export are the Alpha and Omega of business success.
114171	Excellent.
114172	Well done.
114173	Very good.
114174	Ahhhh. Good, good.
114175	That's some good news, for a change.
114176	One less problem.
114177	Well, we can close that file now.
114178	One less distraction. Very good.
114179	Good, that's one less thing to worry about.
114180	Happy to hear that's over.
114181	Good to know that's settled.
114182	Now that it's over, maybe the markets will stabilize.
114183	Good to see that finished.
114184	I must admit, you did live up to our expectations.
114185	So, I see you took care of it.
114186	Your solution made sense. Refreshing.
114187	Now that turned out well.
114188	An economical solution. You do good work.
114189	Good thinking. I like the way you work.
114190	Good job! You did it without bankrupting us.
114191	Sam told me you do good work. Glad to see she was right.
114192	You were spot on with that one.
114193	You think outside of the box and you get it done.
114194	Oh please! Give me a break.
114195	Tell me it isn't so.
114196	Tell me that didn't just happen.
114197	That is not what I'd hoped to hear.
114198	Very well, time to look at our contingency plans.
114199	I was expecting better results.
114200	Let's hope that doesn't cost us too much.
114201	Oh, for crying out loud…
114202	What was that supposed to be?
114203	That just means more work in the long run.
114204	Are you trying to ruin our market value?
114205	You did what? What were you thinking?
114206	And I had heard so many good things about you...
114207	Do you have any idea what that just cost us?
114208	You know, you had every opportunity.
114209	To put it bluntly, you have wasted valuable resources.
114210	How am I supposed to increase your net worth when you pull stunts like that?
114211	I know! You're just testing me, right? Please say I'm right.
114212	I can only do my job if you do yours.
114213	You do know we only make money when you succeed, right?
114214	Wait a second. I just have to finish analyzing these reports.
114215	Skip the small-talk! Too much going on today!
114216	So what's the story? I don't have time to waste.
114217	Anything in particular you wanted to talk about?
114218	So, what do you want?
114219	Let me just close this file then you can proceed!
114220	Let's get to the point, shall we?
114221	I'm watching the market reports, so be brief.
114222	I'm listening.
114223	Yes, come in. What is it?
114224	I'll get someone onto it.
114225	I'll see it gets done.
114226	Of course.
114227	So be it.
114228	I know who to talk to.
114229	Approved. Leave everything else to me.
114230	Fair enough. I'll support that.
114231	Just leave it to me.
114232	Do you mind? That's my responsibility.
114233	I'll see what I can do for you.
114234	Rejected.
114235	Definitely not!
114236	Oh no, that's not going to happen.
114237	I don't think so.
114238	Forget it!
114239	You don't know how things work around here.
114240	That completely defies our guidelines. So no.
114241	I cannot afford that. Politically speaking.
114242	Sorry. I'm sticking to the guidelines.
114243	I cannot give you a green light on this.
114244	The way you handle this will have an immense effect on your market value.
114245	I have something here that could let you add a lot of value to your company.
114246	An urgent matter. I'd be glad to assign it to your corporation.
114247	A volunteer is needed to take care of this issue.
114248	An assignment from the very top. I hope you don't disappoint us.
114249	It looks like you're going to be trusted with that.
114250	So, Sam was right about you.
114251	Flawless execution. I have to admit that.
114252	I can see why everybody is talking about you.
114253	Entrusting you with that was a good decision.
114254	You are to be complimented on your success.
114255	Well done. We'll keep you in mind for future assignments.
114256	Good to know you're willing to do what has to be done.
114257	You completed that effectively. Not many could.
114258	That failure will cost us...
114259	Unacceptable.
114260	There will be a public outcry, be aware of that.
114261	You're a little late for a refusal...
114262	Why didn't you just say no in the first place?
114263	So much for your oh-so-famous reliability.
114264	How is the situation developing?
114265	You have anything to tell me about the assignment?
114266	Can you give me a status report?
114267	Don't disappoint us.
114268	Bring me up to date.
114269	How far along are you? I have to plan.
114270	Give me an estimate.
114271	Can I tell the Senate you are working on it?
114272	Yes, that's what they look like.
114273	Yes, that's what I meant.
114274	Exactly. You know what to do.
114275	Good, you found it.
114276	I suppose my description was pretty close. That's it!
114277	That's the place!
114280	Now that you know your destination, please proceed.
114282	Those are indeed the coordinates.
114283	Right. That's your waypoint.
114285	That's the place I meant, yes.
114286	Correct. Now, if you'd just proceed there.
114287	Yes, that's where you need to go.
114288	You call that stealthy?
114289	It's not always about standing out from the crowd, you know.
114290	Very discreet.
114291	You're getting close.
114292	You're close, very close.
114293	You're approaching the area now.
114294	You're there. Do it!
114295	Hmmm. You seem to have a good sense of direction.
114296	Good, we can trust your instincts. You found it.
114297	I have more work for you.
114298	Now that you've laid the foundation. it's time to get down to business.
114299	So, that's one down and now another one just like the other one.
114300	It has been decided. You are authorized to use force.
114301	We can't afford to allow the Orbital Watch to continue like this.
114302	I was asked to recuit someone familiar with military operations.
114303	These terrorists are a threat to the free world. You must act.
114304	A confidential operation. We hope it will have an impact on the Orbital Watch.
114305	I like your no-compromise policy.
114306	The area is much safer now, and that's exactly what was hoped for.
114307	Well done! Your actions in the conflict have had a major impact.
114308	You should have thought of a better strategy.
114309	The political fallout alone...
114310	Well, we'll have to try to recoup those losses somehow.
114311	Time is money. What can I do for you?
114312	The world markets never sleep.
114313	Everything converges here. So grab the opportunities as they arise.
114314	Goods come in, goods go out. Position yourself.
114315	Welcome to the center of global trade.
114316	Let me know what you need and I'll see what the markets have to offer.
114317	Always keep an eye on current market trends.
114318	Welcome, State your business.
114319	The route is registered.
114320	Approved. The route is officially open.
114321	Let's hope this route will be profitable for you.
114322	Good move. Your goods are needed out there.
114323	Your goods will find their buyers on the world markets.
114324	Goods are being sent out!
114325	A promising route you have there.
114326	Buy low and sell high. That's the formula.
114327	Goods are on the way!
114328	Your shipments should arrive in time.
114329	I hope you'll put these goods to good use.
114330	Your request has been granted. Goods are being sent out to you.
114331	I've examined the route. The deliveries will arrive soon.
114332	Goods have been launched. We'll keep you posted on their ETA.
114333	Right. Those goods should be incoming shortly.
114334	Delivery will be expedited.
114335	Done.That route is history.
114336	Good. I'll delete the route from the register.
114337	Certainly. Network optimization is an ongoing process.
114338	Either it's profitable or it has to be deleted.
114339	That will free up some capacity.
114340	That trade permit is about to expire.
114341	Don't forget, that permit expires soon.
114342	This was a temporary route. You'll either have to renew it or deregister it.
114343	Our trade agreements are due to expire soon.
114344	The permit for this route has almost run out. Do you want to extend, or not?
114345	This route will soon be history. What do you want to do about it?
114346	So, you've had time to evaluate this route. What's next?
114347	Just a reminder that the permit for this route expires soon.
114348	That's it. Shall I renew the contract?
114350	You've read the reports. Do you want to renew the permit?
114351	Time to either renew the permit or cancel the route. Your call.
114352	Decision time. Renew the permit or drop it?
114356	You should seize the moment, if you have need!
114357	Buy low and sell high, that's the rule. The price is good.
114358	If you have the credits, this is the time to buy.
114359	Prices have dropped. This is a good time to buy, if you're interested.
114360	You might want to consider buying soon, if you have the credits.
114361	Now's the time! You should sell if you can.
114362	Prices are at a premium. Now is the time to sell.
114363	If you sell your surpluses now, you could make a healthy profit.
114364	Time to sell, if you're interested. The price won't get much better than this.
114365	I think you should sell your excess stock. The time is ripe!
114366	It's a volatile market right now. Have a look!
114367	There's a lot of fluctuation in the market at the moment. There's money to be made if you're careful.
114368	There's so much happening in the market right now. Opportunities and risks...
114369	You could make some real money trading in this volatile market, but you'd have to be careful.
114370	This is the kind of market that gives traders gray hair. Keep your eyes open.
114371	You know, if I were you I would exhaust the massive saving potential within your company. We know it's important to minimize purchasing expenses by consolidating... are you even listening?
114372	Sam Beaumont? Oh, I remember when she was but a minor representative. Worked with me back then. But let's be honest: She's better with people than with numbers.
114373	Corruption? Look, these days everything is about commerce. And the Big Five are major players on the world markets. We cannot avoid having one or two special arrangements with them.
114374	If the Lunar License Program keeps advancing at this rate, they'll soon have to give me a new job title. Secretary of Pan-Orbital Commerce. I like the sound of that.
114375	The Orbital Watch are the major political challenge of the decade. And I'm afraid we won't overcome them easily.
114963	Greetings, Anthony Goodwin. Secretary for Pan-Terrestial Commerce. If you have any requests concerning the World Markets, come to me.
115890	Beaumont did right to bank on you. Your cooperation has has been more than satisfactory.
115613	There, that's where the bleedin' cowards attacked us. Still circlin' our cargo ships like a swarm o' black flies!
115615	And I see they've brought reinforcements. Gotta be careful. I've seen 'em before, they've no compunctions at all.
115631	Press past their blockade and free our ships. I got your back!
115632	Now, full speed ahead!
115633	Takin' the brunt, eh? Don't worry, my drones will fix that.
116006	Repair drones are runnin' full tilt! Should get the damage under control!
115634	Don't be above salvagin' your enemies' wrecks. There's some rare stuff to be found amidst the lost cargo.
115635	See, wherever you go there's people pesterin' you with their troubles. But... sure, we should help 'em out, I reckon.
115636	Looks we're not the only ones havin' trouble with the Orbital Watch! And if a common enemy ain't no reason to help 'em out …
115637	Energy cells at full power! You should try out the special weaponry I equipped your fleet with.
115638	Now listen. Just shootin' ain't everything. You can equip your fleet with a wide array of special weaponry. Could save your bacon.
115639	So, we've saved the cargo, but I can't say the same for that sector. Won't be easy to drive 'em terrorists out permanently. Gonna become a plague 'round here.
115640	Or you wanna stay and give the rest of them what for, too?
115641	You see. Those lousy privateers attack any material transport ships that go through there.
115642	Send them to the seabed before they do the same to our material shipment. I got your back!
115643	Damn it! Gotta pull back for now. Maybe we'll get the next delivery through here somehow.
115644	Alright, we've saved the cable. Can't say the same for that sector. They're gonna keep on raidin' cargo ships. And next time, you'll be on yer own.
115736	Good. No Orbital Watch flies circlin' that one anymore. But that's not the only ship needin' help.
115528	They attacked us outta nowhere! Sunk me all me ships and took over the cargo. Now they're blockading the whole sector. No transports are gonna make it through anymore.
105518	Bah, isn't that typical! Now that there's trouble, the Union comes crawling! You can be happy that the blockade ships piss me off even more...
105519	A few nimble battleships would make short work of those dumpy clippers! Could build myself some if I had a decent workshop.
105731	Ah, good. That'll let me set up a small dry dock, at any rate. But don't be expectin' any miracles from me!
105732	I don't have more than few tons of material, myself. Have to see how far they get us!
105520	Well, that'll be enough for one ship! While I'm at it, I'll be happy to add a few guns to your command ship. I reckon you're gonna need 'em soon enough.
105536	It's all good and fine with Ms. Beaumont running around like everything's on the stopwatch. But without some specialized construction tech, there ain't gonna be much happening.
115504	Yeah, Rafferty here! Escorting the HTV Horizon, carryin' yer cable. Position is 50.0, 8.26. We're approaching yer sector, over.
115505	Yeah, Rafferty here! Ms. Beaumont assigned me to ensure the transport's safety. Approaching your sector, over.
120060	Yeah, Rafferty here! Ms. Beaumont assigned me to ensure the transport's safety. Approaching your sector, over.
116004	Name's John Rafferty. Ms. Beaumont assigned me to ensure the transport's safety. The ships should be arrivin' here any minute.
115518	What the blazes…
115537	Code red! We are under attack! Code red!
120061	What... Code red! We're being attacked!
115520	All hands to the guns! Bring about ship!
115521	Don't let 'em cut us off! Break through, break through...
115522	Damn it... The cargo... Protect the ship!
115523	All hands, fall back! Fall back, will ya!
115524	Orbital Watch! Better watch out for me, they should! I'll get back what's ours, you'll see!
115526	Attacked us outta nowhere! Bunch o' cowards sunk all me ships and hijacked the transport. Had a close call meself, I did!
116005	Alright, we're approachin' the sector, over.
115531	If you wanna get back what's yours, you'll need some decent battleships to deal with theirs.
115536	I sent you the coordinates for where they attacked us. If you wanna start a fight over what's yours, I'll cover yer back.
115564	There's that ol' dockyard in this sector. Still has some half-done battleships in the dry dock that I can whip into shape. Just bring me the materials.
115592	That'll be enough. Let's build us a fleet that'll kick their arses right back into orbit, eh.
115608	The fleet's ready to depart. The Orbital Watch better watch out for us, sure enough!
115646	Right. Elevator cable's tight. Car's fixed. Startin' the test run in three, two, one …
116019	Right. Elevator cable's tight. Car's fixed. Startin' the test run!
116068	Bah, could've told ya so. Without some specialized construction tech, there ain't gonna be much happening.
116073	Where did ya get that? A little past it's prime, don't ya think? But as long as it does the job.
116314	Yes, that's what I'm talking about! Icebreaker docks, here we come!
115845	And don't forget! We're goin' to need high-grade heat-resistant steel for the lauchin' pads. The stuff we have here won't do.
105619	Ah, so yer back! Now, what about that steel I asked for? Hope that's not all in cold storage in your arctic warehouses!
105620	Yeah, that's the thing! The metal deliveries are comin' in at a good rate now!
105622	Hopefully everybody knows how to do their job. Launchers, colony shuttles, boosters... There's still a lot of work to be done!
105623	Okay! That's it from our side! Now all that's left is to christen the launch ramp!
115846	Ah, I see you got the steel I've been askin' for. With enough workers, I could build you that launch ramp in no time!
115847	Oh my! Look at 'em, soarin' off into the unknown... what? No, it's none of that... I must've just gotten some smoke in my eyes.
116319	Sorry, delivery'll be comin' in late. If at all. Sudden storms are poppin' up all across the Arctic Ocean. Never seen anything like it before.
116321	No way I'm sending me ships out in a storm like that! Sorry, but the delivery is on hold.
115873	So, yer done up there, are ye? But if you want me to build one o' them transmitters, too, you gotta bring me the basic building blocks. Has to exactly mirror the one up there, right?
115874	Here goes! Let's see if that fusion energy transmitter tech is worth all the hassle.
116285	Hey, get a move on! New work comin' in!
116286	Oi, 'nuff loafin' around! We gotta be gettin' on with it.
116287	I'm only waitin' for you.
116288	Could use a hand or two with that!
116289	Ah, how am I supposed to do this kinda thing alone? Come and gimme a hand, will ya?!
116290	Hey! Got a little work to do here. Wanna join in?
116008	Bunch o' rats, layin' hand on our ships. Give 'em hell!
116009	Get our ships out of there, and in one piece!
116010	One scratch, just one scratch, and I'll... I'll... Just go and get'em!
116017	Another ship to go! Don't leave 'em hanging!
116018	Grand. But ya haven't freed all of 'em yet.
116020	Being human leverage ain't fun, y'know. So just keep goin' and save 'em all!
111330	Sound work!
111331	Not bad.
111332	Looks alright to me.
111333	Grand.
111334	Could be worse, eh?
111335	That's really somethin'.
111336	Works for me.
111337	Fair play.
111338	Couldn't have done it better meself.
111339	Done and dusted, that.
111340	Been waitin' yonks for someone t' take care o' that...
111341	Good. Was about to go fix it meself.
111342	Ah, finally, someone worked that mess out!
111343	Fine bit of work there.
111344	You know what work is, you do!
111345	Really gotta hand it to you! The things you do...
111346	You've brought it into line!
111347	You know your craft, sure as rain.
111348	You know the drill, you do!
111349	You took care of that right neatly.
111350	Gotta say, you surprised me, you did!
111351	You run a tight ship! Good on ya!
111352	Put your back into it, eh? Thankyou.
111353	That was right gammy, wasn't it just?
111354	Bad enough.
111355	Brutal, that.
111356	Not an awful lot better.
111357	Get outta here!
111358	Ain't no use.
111359	Ya think it'll work out, and then...
111360	Bah!
111361	Right banjaxed, that.
111362	Darn, that means work...
111363	And ya thought that would work, did ya?
111364	Ya bungled that one, ya did!
111365	You kiddin'? That's it?
111366	If you ain't got a clue, just leave it alone next time!
111367	You could as well have left it alone.
111368	Why didn't ya leave that to the professionals?
111369	Ya shoulda called me.
111370	What were you thinkin'?
111371	Tryin' to prove somethin' or what? That turned out great..
111372	And now? You got any more great ideas?
111373	Somethin' you want me to do?
111374	Hmm?
111375	Good day. Need somethin' built?
111376	Who's bothering me?
111377	Alright, what can I do for you?
111378	So much for workin' in peace and quiet...
111379	Ha, where you been hidin'? On the doss again?
111380	Lemme alone! Can't you s... ah, it's you!
111381	What's that? Talk louder, it's a workshop here.
111382	How are ya?
111383	It's what I'm here for, innit?
111384	Then let's lay the keel!
111385	Got it. Shouldn't take all that long!
111386	Somebody's gotta do it.
111387	It's not like I have anything else to do...
111389	Alright. But don't you be naggin' at me!
111390	Honestly, what would ya do without me?
111391	You're the boss!
111392	Right. I'll throw something together for ya!
111393	You came to just the right fella!
111394	Hmm, no...
111395	Not a hope!
111396	I don't have the tools for that!
111397	And drop everything else? Not happenin'!
111398	Later... Naw, never.
111399	Pullin' my leg, are ya?
111400	As if you couldn't do it on your own.
111401	You know, I've got other things to do.
111402	You got no other folk to take care of that?
111403	Did ya really think I'd do that?
111404	I'd do it meself, but then nuttin' else would get done around here!
111405	I can't be lookin' after that too.
111406	These idiots got no idea what they're about! I'd rather a professional took care of it.
111407	Don't ya be gettin' the idea this is my job, maybe you'd wanna have a go.
111408	This's been lying here a while now.
111409	Wanna do something for me for a change?
111410	That's the way of it!
111411	And here was I thinkin' that was all for nowt...
111412	Keep up the good work!
111413	Looks like at least someone knows their job...
111414	Looks like I can leave that to you from here on in...
111415	Color me gobsmacked! Good one.
111416	Hard work pays off!
111417	Yeah, now that's somethin' we can work with!
111418	Looks like someone does their job right...
111419	Somethin' of a mess, that...
111420	And ya wonder why I'm pissed off...
111421	Come on, ya not tellin' me ya can't cut it, are ya?
111422	Should have done it meself...
111423	What? Ya wanna hug or something?
111424	Here for a coffee break, eh? I reckon we got somethin' better to do...
111425	I'm relying on ya, y'know?
111426	Get on wit ya, you'll be fine!
111427	Work going alright?
111428	You sure take your time...
111429	Nowt for it, got be done.
111430	Yeah, away with you! Just keep goin'!
111431	Work just never ends, eh?
111432	So, what's the deal, then?
111433	Ah, you've found it already!
111434	Hmm...
111435	Just what we need.
111436	Kept your eyes open, eh?
111437	Ah, there it is.
111438	Looks like the thing, eh?
111439	Right, what else could it be.
111440	Look what we got here.
111441	Bang on.
111442	Don't keep those fellas waiting...
111443	Yep, we were right about the location.
111444	Crack on, then!
111445	Why aren't ya on your way already?
111446	What ya waiting for?
111447	There.
111448	Right around the corner, eh?
111449	Go ahead!
111450	Yep, there you go.
111451	Bah, leavin' work half-finished.
111452	Don't like to get your hands dirty after all, eh?
111453	It's not work that kills, but worry.
111454	Nice job. And the next project is already waiting!
111455	I know! You think you're finally done... and then something comes up...
111456	Can you do this one at the same time? Then it'll be out of the way...
111457	Ah, darn it, they got us.
111458	Sneaky, eh? Right...
111459	Their detection systems work fine, for sure.
111460	Don't dawdle now. You're almost there.
111461	Go ahead! We're close.
111462	Hmmm, yeah, draw it closer.
111463	Ah, there we have it!
111464	Seems all the rummaging is over at last.
111465	Didn't stay hidden for long, eh?
111466	Let's see how me ships do in the field...
111467	Don't tell me you're backin' down...
111468	You can handle risks like that, can't ya?
111469	Ready our weapons systems. Those fellas are spoiling for a fight!
111470	Drivin' about, shootin' at people. We have to show some fight.
111471	Hah, you sure gave them a thrashin'!
111472	We make a good team. My equipment and your strategy!
111473	Serves 'em right!
116011	Hah, you showed 'em. Knew you had it in ya.
116012	A bunch o' ships. On the bottom of the sea. None of 'em ours. I'd call that a happy ending.
116013	Swoopin' in and saving the day! Our crews will thank ya for it!
111474	Ah, those sods have gone and wrecked all of my hard work!
111475	Next time they'll get a right beltin'!
111476	Oh, fine strategy there, Lord Nelson...
116014	Poor sods... still gotta sort out those bloody terrorists.
116015	What? Wanna leave our ships in the greedy claws of those extremists?
116016	Thougt we'd be able to save 'em. Damn shame, that.
111477	Why the sudden retreat?
111478	Bah, we still could've won.
111479	Everyone outta here then!
111480	All ships. Fall back.
111481	Less dangerous from afar, eh?
111482	Quality work, you'll see.
111484	Just launched! Go on, have a look!
111485	All ready for 'er maiden voyage!
111486	Youse already thought of a name for 'er?
111487	She'll get your stuff from here t' there, don't worry.
111488	She'll make the seas a fair bit safer.
111489	Purrs like a kitten! Fights like a tiger!
111490	Your enemies better watch out for this one.
111491	Ain't she just the sleek, dangerous beauty?
111492	She'll put up a good fight, cross my heart.
111493	It's a fine little machine!
111494	That'll get your building projects crackin'.
111495	Good choice. Fastest way to build such things, that is.
111496	Sure. You can't really build that without one.
111497	That'll push your space program forward!
111498	Ah, come on, she was in sound condition!
111499	Yeah, you're right. Got too many of 'em as it is.
111500	Ah, she still brought you a tidy little sum...
111501	Good call. Finally, ye replace that ol' tub.
111502	Sometimes you just have to part with stuff, right?
111503	Right. The new one looks better anyway.
111504	Hah, nothing me lads and I can't fix.
111505	Give it a new lease of life, alright!
111506	Ah, I see what's wrong with 'er. No worries.
111507	Here you go, as good as new!
111508	Hm, think I got 'er just about right.
111509	Brought the ship up to date.
111510	Threw all the ol' crap out.
111511	Shape up or ship out? We're doing both, eh?
111512	Alright. Time to make some improvements.
111513	Good systems are half the battle.
111514	Everything installed. Give it a try.
111515	Good call. Could've gotten outta hand at any moment.
111516	Gave the order. All ships are retreatin'.
111517	So, pullin' in our horns, are we?
111518	Here they come!
111519	How 'bout a little fireworks!
111520	Called some pals of ours.
111521	Support's on the way.
111522	And the lights go out!
111523	Don't move!
111524	Come on, my busy bees, do your work.
111525	Overhauling in progress.
111526	Shields online!
111527	Shields and turbines at full power.
111528	Off you go!
111529	Wavin' 'em off!
111530	Torpedo away!
111531	Wait for the boom!
111532	That big fella will show them.
111533	Surface!
111534	Dropping the bomb!
111535	Are you freezin' yet?
111536	Repair systems online.
111537	Takin' care of the damages.
111538	Energy shields up!
111539	Hull fortified!
111540	Come to Daddy.
111541	Let's stir things up a wee bit.
111542	No hard feelings, but I've got me work to do. You wanna talk to me about me "doubtful past"? Go find yourself one of them muckrakers or something!
111543	Course I can pilot these beauties! Think I'm one of those daft academics or something? No, you name it, I've taken a turn at the wheel. Other than space shuttles. But I reckon I'll get plenty of opportunities the next few days.
111544	I'm not the type to bootlick, but I gotta admit it feels good to be back in construction. Tell the Beaumont girl I said thanks for givin' me the chance.
111545	[Hums to himself]... What! Can't I be in a good mood for a change?
111546	Look after your vehicles well. You can have all that big industry and all, but if you can't move your stuff... or protect it... you're finished.
111547	Big Five, eh? Trust them as far as I can spit, them money-grubbing vultures. Had something going there at one their security divisions, 'til they axed the whole place!
111548	Must say, the Ibarra-FoxCom tech ain't no slouch. But the designs... Too spick 'n span. If there ain't some screws stickin' out, it's not the real thing.
111549	Busy company you got. All them tiny little ants running around doin' their jobs. Hope they're doing 'em right.
111550	Thanks for keeping bureaucracy to a reasonable level. Worked on other projects before... and I spent more time with a keyboard than a wrench.
111551	I'm lookin' forward to buildin' me a workshop on the Moon. No more strains from heavy liftin'.
111552	Happy St. Paddy's day! May the most you wish for be the least you get!
114964	Name's John Rafferty. Ya need anything that flies, floats or shoots, I'm your man. As long as ya not overdoin' the socializin'.
115649	Still got space for additional ships.
115650	Capacity we got. Could build some more ships.
115651	Yer fleet's a tad... incomplete, if ye ask me...
115652	Sad sight, all them empty moorings.
115653	If you don't repair that, it's gonna rust!
115654	Not gonna let it out on the water in that condition!
115655	Just takes up space, if it's broken!
115656	Just look at it. It needs a major overhaul!
115657	I could have a look at that ship now. Sure I can improve something.
115658	The old model had its day. Lemme give that ship an update.
115659	That ship's got some potential for improvement. Just say the word.
115660	That one's not living up to its potential. I could change that.
115661	If we modernize that system now, we'll improve it.
115662	Got me the newest firmware for this. Shall I install it, then?
115663	I can still improve that system. Just a little fine calibration.
115664	You have to keep your systems up to date, hear me!
115665	Your ships are already the best they can be!
115666	I'd say everything's as good as it gets!
115667	Be proud of your fleet. The best of the best!
115668	Could tinker with your ships all day. Couldn't get any better.
115669	They're all in top condition!
115670	As I see it, they're all ready to go.
115671	No major damage left on them. All fine.
115672	Nothin' to repair on those.
115673	What? Don't wanna give your dock crew somethin' to do?
115674	Loud, greasy, that's how docks are. No reason to not come round.
115675	I'm sittin' on me hands all day. Gimme some tasks for the docks.
115676	Such a fine dockyard, just gatherin' dust. 'Tis a shame...
115792	I'm way too old for adventures like that. Gotta pass next time, so you better make sure you got a decent battlefleet. Stop by the dockyard if you want any ships built or revamped and that.
115793	Found us, did ya? Here's where all the lil' ships come from. It's also where they're repaired or improved. Just give the order.
115794	Just to let ye know, I'll be establishin' a dockyard in every sector you have a branch in. The one here's already operational.
115795	In case you wondered, I built us a dockyard here, too. Didn't bring the ships from your southernmost sectors though, seeing as they're not built fer the cold and all. Ye'll have to build yerself a new fleet here.
116007	Ah, moon vehicles. Was 'bout time I got some new challenges. The assembly hangar here is already operational!
115889	Not for me, all those celebrations and that. But I gotta say, nice work.
116220	You trying to be modest?
116221	Aw, come on!
116222	Hm, didn't picture you as the type.
116223	Break a leg!
116224	So about your will... Nah, just messing!
116225	Go get'em!
116226	Quite the daredevil, aren't we?
116227	Don't come back crying, alright?
116228	It's gonna go juuust fine.
115862	You're welcome. If it wasn't for me, you'd all be toast right now. Thing is, I couldn't let tech that promising be lost. You see, nothing personal.
115863	And you shouldn't count on that being the only ace Drake's gonna play. He's researching weapon technology in a secret Earth base as we speak. Just to let you know!
115864	Who am I? You should ask A.D.A.M. We were in close touch. But you want a name, how about... Tess or Izz or Akiak or something like that. Your choice.
115961	Quite the dead end, huh? Well, doesn't have to be. I know where Drake hides his data. It's a fair ways away from the Moon. You want it, you either provide me a team of capable data engineers or we'll do a little home visit.
115962	Okay, we've calibrated your satellites to directly access Drake's earthside servers. I made sure to leave Drake one of my little homemade viruses. It has a thing for devouring files containing fusion weapon research …
115963	There! All accessed and fed in into your own database. Hope you don't mind I made my own backup. Just in case.
115964	There, Drake's fortress of solitude. And I see it's pretty well guarded. Nothing you can't cope with, I hope.
115965	Get me to a server access point or something so I can hack into their database. Could be we'll have to find more than one, though.
115966	Keep your ships together on the way and everything should be fine. You ready?
115967	Alright, gonna plug in from here. I'll be busy for a while. Keep Drake's battleships off our back!
115968	Hold on... and... another line... and... done!
115969	Oh, come on. You expect stop me with that? Need just a sec and... done!
115970	Now, let's move on to the next one.
115971	Still one to go! Move it!
115972	Okay, one more.
115973	Nice! That's how you do an inside job! Got the data you wanted. Plus a few files for me, just out of... private interest.
116335	Secretary Sam Beaumont. Asking me for help. It's been a while. But it's true. Drake maintains a secret military base on Earth. If you somehow could get me access, I could cause some mayhem on their servers.
116336	Drake maintains a secret military base on Earth. All of the Orbital Watch's secrets, safely stored in one place. I just need a team of capable data engineers and I can access them from here. Or we'll do a little home visit.
116337	As we speak, Drake is researching devastating weapons systems based on the fusion research results.
116338	I know where he stores that data. Give me a team of good data engineers and I'll access it from here. Or we'll go get it in person.
116345	I made sure to leave Drake one of my little homemade viruses. It has a thing for devouring files containing fusion weapon research.
116351	Fusion weapons. Drake has a secret base on Earth where he develops them based on the LEC fusion research. And it seems your colony will be the first target.
116354	But you can stop them. They're still working on the prototypes in their base. If you somehow could get me access, I could cause some mayhem on their servers. Plus get you the LEC fusion research data.
116358	Now, give me just a sec... There. Earth. Drake has a secret base on Earth, where he researches fusion weapon systems.
119676	Secretary Sam Beaumont. Asking me for help. Has been a while. But it's true. Drake maintains a secret military base on Earth. If you could get me access somehow, I could cause some mayhem on their servers.
119677	Okay, we've calibrated your satellites to directly access Drakes earthbound servers. Made sure to leave Drake one of my homebred viruses. It has a gusto for devouring files containing weapon research.
119693	Nice! That's how you do an inside job! Made sure to leave Drake one of my homebred viruses. It has a gusto for devouring files containing weapon research.
115875	Don't worry. Won't rain on your parade. But you should save the socializing for later and take the next shuttle back up.
115897	I'm here for the crisp, clear Arctic air. Helps me concentrate while I'm coding.
115390	Didn't you check your social media? I need you at the project site.
115391	Our project reached a new level! Wanna see?
115392	Hey, I need your input on our little enterprise!
115393	You doing anything at the moment? If not, why not listen what I have to say?
115394	Such a nice business proposal, and still no one wants to join in. Hint, hint!
115395	Interested in a little joint venture? Just drop by.
116306	What to do with this old ruin? Well, I have an idea. Of course, no 'satisfaction guaranteed or your money back'! And you'd have to invest a lot before it pays off!
115267	Okay, I'm sure you've heard of the First Wave of 2102. Dozens of corporations pushing into space to get a piece of the Moon. Sounds familiar, right?
115269	Some of these lunar entrepreneurs had a vision: A great leisure facility for the richest of the uber-rich! One world economic crisis later... We have an ugly unfinished block out in the grey.
115270	Or rather the future site of the next must-go luxury hotel complex? Well, you tell me. I'm just the facilitator. All of the profits are yours if you let me do my stuff. Fair?
115280	Okay. Our hotel is ready for the grand opening. I decided for a soft launch, just a few selected guests! Interesting people, especially one of them...
115282	Our guests are all checked in and the credits are rolling in. How about you just lie back for now, while I monitor... the daily routines here. Keep checking your inbox.
115283	Nothing new happening. I'll get back to you when our guests start to feel bored.
115284	There's a big discussion on the net about our war tours. The press calls 'em morbid and unethical. You can't have better publicity! Time to think about our next big happening.
115285	Busy planing our next big happening. I'll call again later.
115281	Rad. Hope you don't mind, but I've given our android stewards a vision recorder update.
115286	And here we are, your hotel, where Earth's who's-who are all dining together. And, where a certain someone is concerned, I've got it all on tape. Means I'm off the project. Enjoy your profits!
116309	In private? Oh, of course.
116310	You can keep all the profits yourself. I'm totally fine with my role as a... silent observer.
116021	The Orbital Watch stored secret information inside this base. Information that should interest you. Just get me to their network access points, okay?
116022	Hacked myself in their systems a while back. The research they're conducting here... You wouldn't like what they'd be able to do if they complete it. Get me in and I'll leave them a nice data bomb.
116023	Found out the Orbital Watch stores tactical data on their next moves here. To access it, I have to plug directly into their main servers. Your job is to get me there, okay?
116030	I'm through here. Get me to the next access point!
116031	I'm through here! Let's move on!
116032	That one's taken care of! Next!
116033	That's our way into their network!
116034	What are you waiting for? Take me there!
116035	C'mon, it's right there.
111553	That was sick!
111554	Slick.
111555	Nice one.
111556	How rad.
111557	Like that.
111558	Tight!
111559	Pretty sweet job.
111560	Pretty cool.
111561	Obstacle removed. I'll spread the news.
111562	That's one less problem to worry about.
111563	One less bump in the road.
111564	I'll give you a Like for that.
111565	You use information effectively. That's good. Not many people do.
111566	You're very efficient.
111567	You did a good job. The net reports reflect that.
111568	You took the logical steps.
111569	I think you cleaned that situation up well.
111570	You sure debugged that situation, didn't you?
111571	You got in the first run. Congratulations.
111573	Total loss.
111574	Ooooh, bomb.
111575	Garbage in, garbage out.
111576	That is so grody.
111577	That sucks!
111578	Okay, that could have gone better.
111579	That was what I'd call sub-optimal.
111580	Well, that screwed some variables around pretty bad.
111581	You couldn't hack it, huh?
111582	You blew it.
111583	You are such a Christopher.
111584	I'm sure glad they don't have you programming life support systems.
111585	If I coded the same way you ran that mission, I'd be selling ice cream.
111586	You can do better than that. At least, I sure hope you can.
111587	That was totally off your norm.
111588	You should read the flames you're getting for that one!
111589	One sec... yeah, go ahead.
111590	Just let me log out here… So, what's up?
111591	Let me just save this file… What do you need?
111592	Lemme just finish this… So what can I do for you?
111593	I knew it was you. Just between us, you might want to upgrade the security package on your mobile.
111594	Why are you here? You could have reached me via the Net.
111595	Oh, it's you. Why the face to face? Lose your Net access?
111597	You? Here? Do you know how inefficient face-to-face is?
111600	Affirmative.
111602	Accepted and implemented.
111603	Let me just enter that… Done.
111605	Can do.
111606	Coded and loaded. It's a go.
111607	Will do. I'll contact you when I want something in return.
111608	Affirmative. You now owe me one.
111609	Of course I can do that. I'll get in touch when it's time for you to pay me back.
111610	As long as you realize nothing in life is free.
111611	I do something for you, you do something for me. I'll let you know what, where and when.
111612	No. Busy.
111613	No time right now.
111614	Not available right now.
111615	Coding. Leave me alone.
111616	Uh-uh, sorry, no time.
111617	Sorry, you are way back in the line.
111618	No. You know better than to bother me when I'm coding.
111619	Like to help you, but I'm busy right now.
111620	Sorry, no can do.
111621	No, that won't be happening.
111622	Do it and things will happen. Good things.
111623	Up for a little challenge?
111624	Let's see if you can debug this one…
111625	Found something on the Net you might be interested in.
111626	A flag popped up on a bulletin board I watch. Thought it might be up your alley.
111627	Here. Test your skills on this one.
111628	Your name is all over the net.
111629	Congratulations. Searches for your name on the Net have skyrocketed.
111630	Post analysis is excellent. Good job.
111631	Your actions caused a lot of Net traffic. General tenor is positive, though.
111632	You're all over the forums. People seem thankful.
111633	Your work generated some interesting data curves. Thanks.
111634	Your solution is trending on the Net right now.
111635	Not bad. The analysis shows your solution to be close to optimum.
111636	Want a new identity? Just in case this comes back to haunt you.
111637	Honestly, didn't you look at your intel?
111638	Checked the Net lately? You are so burnt…
113465	Sometimes you just have to admit that it's time to bail.
113466	Bailing in the middle of a job? Never would've thought.
113467	You gotta know when to hold 'em, and know when to fold 'em.
112966	Gimme a status update.
112967	Still got it in the backlog?
112968	You're hanging behind.
112969	You haven't come far on the progress bar yet.
112970	Either my tracking tool is lagging, or you really haven't finished it yet?
112971	So what's the what?
112972	The details, again? You should really keep your cloud up to date.
112973	Your company page says something about "fast solutions". Can I count on that?
111639	This object will be relevant.
111640	This thing is important.
111641	Log this thing, it's important.
111642	Save the loc data on this thing, 'cause you'll need it.
111643	Don't forget this little item!
111644	My data says this is the one, alright.
111645	This is the object in question.
111646	Yeah, that one.
111647	Coordinates confirmed.
111648	Verifying destination. Confirmed.
111649	GPS says that's the spot.
111650	Accessing satellite feeds. Coordinates correct.
111651	Triangulation completed. That's the spot.
111652	Yeah, those are the designated coordinates, alright.
111653	The coordinates match the ones on the Net.
111654	I told you those were the right coordinates.
111655	Might not look that way at first glance, but this is related.
111656	This is the next step in the sequence.
111657	Relax, it's just a recursion step.
111658	Secret military information. Thought you might want to chip in.
111659	The combat data I've been able to acquire shows you have a good chance.
111660	Looking at the logistic streams, there's some shooting going on out there.
111661	Interesting. Three military surveillance satellites just focused on that area.
111662	If you're looking to test your military tech, my data indicates there's no time like the present.
111663	A heroic victory... just to quote the respective news pages.
111664	You see what a difference good intel can make?
111665	It's nice to see someone make use of all that hard-won intel for a change.
116024	And they didn't even know what hit them. Nice.
116025	Wasn't easy hacking their mainframe, and without you I wouldn't have made it.
116026	And done! Left them a little present while I was logged in. They won't have any disk space problems for a while.
111666	Will be hard to cover up your incompetence here.
111667	If you'd read your intel reports, none of that would have happened.
111668	This is gonna be really hard to whitewash.
116027	Coding takes time, okay?! You have to give me more than this!
116028	We're lucky we got out of there in one piece!
116029	That's exactly why I'm not into analog access. People shoot at you and in the end you got nothing!
111669	You didn't hear this from me.
111670	You may not realize, but you've made a huge impact. Thanks.
111671	Good that none of this ever happened, right?
111672	Trust me on this one. It'll help us all.
113552	You really wanna make a difference?
113553	Lemme give you a tip. Pun intended.
111673	Adequate compensation for an adequate decision.
113554	You see, everybody wins.
113555	And here's your loot.
111674	Playing the upright citizen, huh? Guess I have to put more sugar on it next time.
113556	Alright. No cookie for you, then.
113557	Fine. But don't think I've given up on you goody two-shoes.
111675	Think you can just stay on the sidelines forever? I have offers waiting here that are sure to bring you back onto the field.
113558	Decisions, decisions, right?
113559	Still so cautious? Well, there's always next time.
111676	Me? Well, you know me better than you think. Through the things I do for you. From the things I tell you. Everything else... come on. Just sugarcoating, isn't it?
111677	People seem to think I'm a complete loner. I'm not. I grew up in a lovely family and I'm a twin. I just get really focused when I work, and I, uh, work a lot.
111678	Everything runs strictly according to protocol at the corporation. Well, that's what they'd like you to think.
111679	Just updated my comment filter. I wonder what people did before we had these... I bet you've heard of that "Godwin's law" or whatever it was called.
111680	I love this. It's like being the spider in the middle of a web of pure data, drawing the strands to create something new.
111681	Everybody tries to manipulate information to their own benefit. The Big Five, the corporation, you, me - everybody. It's human nature.
111682	Data security is so important. If everyone had access to all the information on the Net, there would be complete and utter chaos.
111683	People would freak if they knew what's really on the Net. I mean, it's not like anyone tells them what ends up there. Did you know that when the Net started up, people were told "don't want it up, don't do it." Unbelievable, isn't it?
111684	Communication is the most powerful force in the world. Contacting. Staying in contact. We're all just clusters of information, you know? And information has to be free, right?
111685	I went independent once I realized I couldn't trust anyone else's moral compass. Everyone's got one, and I like to think I'm following mine. Even villains are heroes in their own stories, right?
111686	The better my skills got, the more information I had. That's when I became an independent. Lets me sleep better at night.
111687	The skills and ability to manipulate information mean you have to develop a strong sense of ethics. And it makes you cynical as all hell.
111688	I'm not ALL about computers. Sure, there are people who are important to me. That's why I protect their privacy.
111689	People always ask why I'm not with a corporation. Are they kidding? We don't need more monopolies. I mean, I would turn my corporation into one in no time flat.
111690	People seem to think I'm a complete loner. I'm not. I grew up in a lovely family and I'm a twin. I just get really focused when I work, and I, uh, work a lot.
111691	I have a lot of information. Sensitive information. Information is power. That's why I don't see much of my family. To keep them out of the line of fire.
113468	You might want to work on your skills. Or get some sort of cloaking device. That would be cool!
113469	Um, you do know that you can be tracked via the Net whenever your mobile is on, right?
113470	Okay, maybe they couldn't see you, but your electronic footprint was off the scale!
113471	Right. The satellites show you're in the right area, so keep your eyes peeled.
113472	Okay, it looks like you're in the right area. Start refining your search parameters now.
113473	You should be hitting the target area now. Switch from nav to scanners and scan the area.
113474	Scanned and logged. That's it, alright.
113475	Okay, my scan data shows that's the one. Good work.
113476	Told you you'd find it if you just trust your info and your gear.
114978	Let's skip the introduction. Already know enough about you. And not much to tell about me, other than I like to... push a few buttons every now and then.
115813	Whoa, you generated some buzz. A lot of decision makers would like to have your support. Like, where the real decisions are made. Think about it.
115814	This is where the course of the world economy is decided. You can influence those decisions. It all depends on who you support. I'll make some recommendations here and there.
116036	Well looky here, a new player in the world economy. Easy to lose track, what with all the options available. But I'm here to offer some incentives.
115810	Never guessed you'd be so conservative. Come on, make your voice count!
115811	The world won't wait for you to change it. Make your choice, make a difference.
115812	Still sticking by the corporation? You could have a voice in world-shaking decisions, you know...
105541	Ah, welcome to Papadakis' Cash and Carry! Whatever it is, Nic is sure to have it... Ah, that! Yes, of course, I have one right here! Super condition. Go ahead, look around!
115482	A little birdy told me you're searchin' for a special piece of tech. As chance would have it, I've just... come by one. We'll talk at my warehouse.
115483	Only the finest quality. Help yourself, my friend!
115484	Don't say anything, my friend! I have just what you're looking for. It's yours, if you don't ask any questions.
116294	Remember our little deal, my friend? You should have another look!
116295	You're not leavin' everything to ol' Nic, are you? There's a lot to do with that project.
116296	My friend, our project needs a little love, know what I mean?
116297	Hello there, my friend. Got myself a little project to keep me busy, Want to join in?
116298	I'm only making this offer to you! This little project of mine - I want you in.
116299	I've got an opportunity for you, my friend, you just won't believe! Come over!
115287	That's somethin' for ol' Nic! I love it, when things go right! I'd like to watch this from up close!
115288	Plannin' for the great happenin', huh? Heard you invited all my business partners! But you're not giving us only veggies to chew on, right?
115289	My friend, thank you for the invitation! Gotta like this place! Very comfortable!
115290	You saved me, my friend! I thought this would be the end of ol' Nic!
115291	That's gonna be a ball, my friend! The perfect setting to talk some business with my partners, in private.
108332	Any news on that job yet?
108333	How's that job going? Any problems?
108334	Good to see you, my friend. So, how's that little job going?
108336	That job going okay, or is there something I need to know?
108337	So. How's our little project going?
108339	Forgive my impatience. I just want to have the matter out of the way.
108340	Yes! Yes, that's it!
108342	That's it, alright.
108343	That's the one.
108344	I see you found it.
108346	That's the one I meant, yes.
108347	You've got it!
108348	That's where you gotta go.
108349	Nic gave you a pretty good map, huh?
108350	Yes, yes, that's the spot!
108351	Good, you found the right spot.
108352	Gotta say, you read a map better than most, my friend.
108354	Right. Now hustle on over there.
108355	Good. Now get a move on, will you?
108391	Look, this isn't exactly legit, but you wouldn't lose by it, my friend.
108392	Interested in a little trip? A... very, very quiet trip.
108393	How good are you at not bein' seen?
108394	You interested in makin' some money, but real quiet like?
108395	Good job! Guess this kinda makes us partners in crime, huh.
108396	Nice! Remember though, nobody says nothing.
108397	Smooth, real smooth, my friend.
108398	Hey, you want to get us thrown in jail, or what?
108399	If they catch you first, you don't know me! Got it?
108400	Some people just don't have the soul, know what I mean?
115471	Look who blew in! Sam Beaumont's drawing card, in the game for the Moon! Nicolo Papadakis, but you can call me Nic. If you're lookin' for a good deal, no questions asked... my warehouse is always open to you.
115476	Ah, I knew there was somethin' goin' on here! Nic Papadakis, Papadakis Enterprises! You want a good deal, just come to my warehouse!
115479	Oh, a new face. Welcome to my little family business. Nic Papadakis, Papadakis Enterprises. Lookin' for quality goods in wholesale quantities? Then look no further than Nic's.
115677	My friend, welcome to Papadakis Enterprises. Can't wait to do business with you! Business friendships are the truest friendships...
115501	A small world, huh! Wherever you go, ol' Nic has been there. And where Nic goes, he brings shiploads of quality goods!
115502	You out here too, my friend? What a lucky shot for us both! Our dealings won't be impeded by distance.
115503	Papadakis Enterprises. Doin' business where the business is. Come and pay your ol' friend a visit!
115498	No way you're gonna avoid makin' a deal or two with ol' Nic. I'll make you a good price.
115499	Haven't seen ya round here lately. How 'bout some horse tradin' amongst friends, huh?
115500	You don't buy from me, you don't sell to me. You're breaking ol' Nic's heart.
115480	Quite the do-it-yourself kinda CEO, aren't you? Drop by my harbor it's always a good place to find lucrative Assignments.
115481	Command Ships. Best way of takin' care of business out at sea. Have you ever considered accepting some Assignments at my harbor? It pays well.
115497	Hey, my friend. Lots of people are asking for you. Want to offer you some Assignments. Come over, huh?
109241	That's good news.
109242	Alright.
109243	That's what I like to hear.
109244	That should make life easier.
109245	Good thing.
109247	Gotta like that.
109248	Good thing that's outta the way.
109249	That's one less thing to worry about.
109250	One less headache.
109251	Hey, you done good!
109252	You're makin' Nic a happy man!
109253	You sure don't beat around the bush, do you?
109254	You just made my day!
109256	I gotta tell you, you're slick.
109258	You did a good thing out there today.
109259	Nicely done, my friend.
109260	I like the way you work.
109262	Today's maybe not so good.
109263	That coulda gone better.
109264	That's not gonna help.
109265	Gotta admit, that's kinda disappointing.
109266	Some days aren't worth gettin' outta bed for, eh?
109267	What's this world comin' to?
109269	This has gotta be a joke.
109270	I can't believe it.
109271	That won't help business at all.
109275	What were you thinking?
109276	You're just pulling Nic's leg, right?
109277	Come on, I'm sure you can do better than that.
109278	You're kiddin', right?
109279	I kind of expected more of you, my friend.
109280	If that's the best you can do, then we are in serious trouble.
109282	You're gonna have to do better than that.
109283	Tell me that didn't just happen.
108427	Welcome to Nic's.
108429	Hey! Come on in.
108431	You came to the right place. Nic has it all.
108432	Welcome to Nic's House of Incredibly Desirable Commodities.
108434	Lookin' for a good deal? I got nothin' but the best!
109284	Nic's, the home of savings!
109285	My prices are so low, even I don't know how I do it.
109288	Hey, look who's here! Good to see ya!
109289	How are you doin'? Long time, no see!
109290	Hey, good to see you, my friend!
109292	Well, if it isn't my favorite customer!
109293	This day is gettin' better by the minute! Come on in!
109294	Good of you to drop in to see me.
109295	Welcome aboard, my friend!
109296	Sure, why not?
109297	Of course.
109298	Happy to.
109299	My pleasure.
109300	No problem.
109301	For you? Of course.
109302	You know all you gotta do is ask.
109303	You know Nic will always help.
109304	Sure, you got it.
109306	Sorry, not today. Tomorrow isn't lookin' so good either.
109307	I don't think so.
109308	The answer is no.
109309	Sorry, no can do.
109310	I think I'm gonna have to say no.
109311	I'd like to help you, but my hands are tied.
109312	You didn't just ask me that, did you?
109313	My friend, I'll just pretend you didn't ask.
109315	Sorry, my friend, can't help you there.
108308	Good of you to drop by! Say, I got a little something needs doing…
108309	Look who's here! You wouldn't be looking for something to do, would you?
108310	Just the one I wanted to see. Mind lending me a hand?
108311	Talk about the right place at the right time! Looking for work?
108315	Didn't expect you out here. Mind helping me out?
108316	What are you doing out here? Busy?
108317	Fancy running into you here. I got a job for you.
108321	I knew you were the right one for the job!
108322	You done great out there, my friend.
108323	Good job out there!
108324	Couldn't have done it better myself!
108325	Now that's the way it's supposed to be done.
108326	I knew you'd do ol' Nic proud!
108329	Are you tryin' to tell me that was the best you could do?
108330	C'mon. You're joking, right? What was that supposed to be?
108331	My friend, I ain't gonna lie. That was pretty pathetic.
113429	Hey, now what?
113430	You're not bailing on me, are you?
113431	My friend, some things just go wrong.
108368	Great job, my friend, but... something else came up. You still in?
108369	Thank you but there's still a little something to be done…
108370	You got that done pretty well. Ready for your next job?
108371	I got something needs takin' care of. Needs a... firm hand, if you get my drift.
108372	If you're not afraid of a little rough and tumble, I might have something for you.
108373	I got a little job needs doin'. Might be a little push and shove involved, know what I mean?
108374	There's something that needs to be done, and it might require a little muscle.
108375	Nic's got a little job for you, if you're not afraid of gettin' your hands dirty.
108376	You, my friend, are no one to mess with.
108377	Ol' Nic knew you'd take care of it. No one messes with you much, do they?
108378	Nice job you did there. Smooth, efficient - final.
108384	Well, at least you're alive, my friend. But you'll have to do better next time.
108385	Pah! You gotta learn how to aim your guns!
108386	That was a joke. You got your ass shot off, my friend.
109341	Welcome to my humble place of business.
109342	Welcome to Ol' Nic's!
109343	You've come to the right place!
109344	We are open for business!
109345	Welcome to my place!
109348	Welcome to Nic's, where the smart money comes.
109351	No one beats Nic's deals.
109352	Always a pleasure, my friend!
109353	You, my friend, have a very good eye.
109354	I like a customer who knows what they want.
109355	I know you'll find that very useful!
109356	Yeah, right. Make an offer I can't refuse.
109357	My friend, we have a deal.
109358	Nic knows a bargain when he sees one!
109359	The right stuff at the right price.
109360	No way I'm gonna say no to a deal like that!
109361	Business friendships are the truest friendships. Wouldn't you agree, my friend?
109362	I tell you, nothing beats sealing a deal that's gonna keep you fed for years to come. Speakin' of which, I wonder what that Volodin needs all the oil for...
109363	The communicator! Ah, don't mind it, my friend. Must be the Global Union Board of Customs. They'll call again. Pretty persistent bunch, let me tell you!
109364	Yes, the Beaumont girl seems sweet enough. But a bit of a stickler for the rules, don't ya think? Must've worked hard just to get where she is now. There are easier ways!
109365	Been working forever to get a license from this Dr. Young. Touchy, touchy fellas, those Arctic Custodians. Well, except this one arctic trader, what was his name? Just the opposite of the doctor. But not nearly as useful.
108401	I know what they say about me. But they all come to me, just the same. Hypocrites.
108403	The world isn't all black and white, my friend. You gotta live in the grey.
108404	Without people like me, nothin' would ever get done around here.
108405	In this life, you're either a fish or a shark.
108406	It's a tough world out there, my friend. Never forget that.
108407	You do what you have to, to get by. Never forget that.
108408	In business, my friend, you're either a fish or a shark. And we all know that fish are nearly extinct.
108409	I just love the ocean.
113432	They spotted us! Move, move!
113433	You gotta learn to stay out of sight, my friend.
113434	Sometimes it's bad to be the center of attention.
113435	Better slow down and have a look around.
113436	You're almost there. Just keep your eyes peeled.
113437	Alright. Gotta be around there somewhere.
113438	What do you know? You got it!
113439	Ol' Nic knew you'd find it!
113440	So... you found it! Can Nic pick 'em, or what?
114980	Ah, so you're the risin' star everyone's talking about. Nicolo Papadakis, Papadakis Enterprises. My friends call me Nic. And good customers are always friends of mine!
115879	Ah, there you are! Everyone everywhere is talkin' about you. And as I always say: Sure, that's a friend of mine! You still remember your friends, right?
13000046	A little birdy told me you're searchin' for a special piece of tech. As chance would have it, I've just ... come by one.
13000050	Smooth, real smooth, my friend. That should make life easier.
13000052	Good job out there! You do what you have to to get by. Never forget that.
115899	Don't listen to him, okay? Just keep going!
115900	Sweet. But no rest for the wicked. That's not the only Stabilizer the Orbital Watch took off us.
115901	That's it! Whew, thanks! I'm really grateful! Seriously, you just prevented a new climate catastrophe.
115974	There. See the mess? Transmitters generating interference all over the place. Plus battleships to guard them.
115975	I'd like to hear Dr. Maverick explain just how we're supposed to cope with such a force, exactly. Glad you're not letting us down here.
115976	Just get rid of the transmitters and things should go back to normal. For now, at least.
116330	Storm's over. Thanks... now we can get back to business.
105604	Yo, don't listen to him. Man, we got nothing to counter these attacks.
115789	Whew... good riddance! We reclaimed the main Stabilizers. The Orbital Watch still controls a large portion of the minor ones, but we're safe for now.
116323	Whoa, sweet! Guess we're gonna see more trade coming through here soon! By the way, the Custodians asked me to provide you the construction tech you need for your spaceport.
116324	Man, I'm so glad you came here! Look at all this traffic! Business has never been so good! Lemme return the favor! I'll deliver the construction machinery for your icebreaker docks! It's on the house!
116325	Okay, about the stuff for your icebreaker docks... All the storms in the area are making it impossible for my freighters to get through. Sorry!
116326	Good news! The Arctic Custodians commissioned me to get you the tech stuff you need for your icebreaker docks. It's already on the way!
116327	Spooky! There shouldn't be any storms up here at all. Our Climate Stabilizers produce totally predictable weather.
116328	Finally! The ships have arrived. Ordered them to unload your stuff directly at the spaceport.
116329	Um... don't mean to disappoint you. But until this Climate Stabilizer problem is solved, my suppliers refuse to enter the sector. No delivery for you 'til it's taken care of.
119695	Yo, don't listen to him. We got nothing to counter such attacks!
116300	Hey! The project's up and running again! Come over!
116301	Yo, I could use a helping hand with our project.
116302	Yeah, 'bout our project. I guess you're needed again!
116303	Hey, mind helping me out a bit? It's something big.
116304	Don't mean to hassle you or nothin', but could you drop by sometime?
116305	Look, I got this... ah, thing going on here. Wanna maybe have a look?
116311	Yo, this area's Custodians only. I may not... Ah, stuff those stupid rules! We're in big trouble here. Got a minute?
114880	Sweet. I'm not really allowed to tell you this, but I've had it up to here with all that Arctic Custodian lone wolf crap!
114881	Fact is, this Climate Stabilizer here's gone crazy. I'm not, like, any kind of expert, but I've been entrusted with monitoring this thing. Not much trade coming my way anyhow…
114889	Okay, materials and stuff have arrived, thanks.
114882	And as messed up as it is, I thought we'd call in a corp to help us out. As long as no one tells Dr. Ice Block…
114884	Okay, we're gonna remove the old Troposphere Regulator for repairs now.
115508	We're also gonna fix all the smaller defects, okay? Gonna take a while.
114885	Our construction bots are working flat out. But you have to give us a little more time. There's something seriously wrong with this Regulator!
114958	Yo, there's news on the Stabilizer! And you shouldn't wonder. Way things are, I had to inform Dr. Young, too...
114887	Just in the nick of time! The climate here's already going down the tubes. Better get back to the repairs.
114888	Gonna take some time to integrate the Troposphere Regulator. I'll catch you later.
114890	Whohoo, all right! I'd say the weather forecast is gonna be a lot more accurate from now on! Thanks, man!
114891	Pretty cold out here now, huh? That's how you know our Stabilizer is running smoothly.
114892	Nice weather, huh? What's that old saying? Make profit while the sun shines. Something like that, anyway.
114893	Sorry, man, but as long as it's pouring cats and dogs out there, I'm staying in here.
114894	Uh uh, no way, man... I hate thunder.
114895	It's natural spectacles like those that make people stay here. Seein' life in a beautiful light, so to say.
115530	Please don't listen to Dr. Worrywart. Tell you what. You make me a partner, and I'll get you the blueprints for a better icebreaker!
116037	The Orbital Watch still has a good chunk of our Climate Stabilizers under their control. They're using some sort of interference transmitter or something to mess around with them. Please, do something about it.
116038	Whew! Good you're here! No one else I can turn to! The Orbital Watch is playing around with our Stabilizers! If someone destroyed the jamming devices they've attached, we could regain control.
116039	Still don't have the situation with the hijacked Climate Stabilizers under control. I mean, it's not like we have a battlefleet or anything. If you could retake the Stabilizers for us, me and my people would be really grateful.
116046	Hm, it's only one. There are more in the network here.
116047	You're gonna have to free them all to return the climate here back to normal. Keep going!
116048	They control all the Stabilizers in this sector. We're not done yet!
116050	It's just ahead. That's one of the Stabilizers they took over.
116051	See that jamming device, there? That's how they control them.
116052	Almost there. That's one of the hijacked Climate Stabilizers.
110839	How cool is that.
110841	Wow, nice one! Sweet!
110842	That's some real good news.
110843	Cool.
110844	Am I glad to hear that.
110845	That totally rocks.
110846	Sweet.
110847	Good stuff.
110848	Yeah, all good.
110849	Likin' it.
110850	Whew, talk about a relief!
110851	Whew, that sure feels better.
110852	Wow, that's a load off my mind.
110853	You were awesome!
110854	You do good work.
110855	Nice going. I mean real nice going.
110856	That was some good work there, you know?
110857	You did a pretty cool job.
110859	You aced it!
110862	You did quite well!
110863	Ah, what a bummer.
110864	That kinda sucks.
110865	That isn't good. Not at all.
110866	Not so cool.
110867	Beastly, beastly.
110868	That's so not good.
110869	I just don't believe it.
110870	That really ain't gonna help.
110872	What a downer.
110873	Not that I'm disappointed but, I mean, y'know …
110874	I really hoped you'd do better.
110875	Please don't tell me you screwed that up.
110876	Look, it sounds harsh, but you really messed up.
110877	Don't sweat it. It'll all be fine, know what I mean?
110878	It's not like you can't do better!
110879	I know how you feel. I've been there!
110880	You blew that one.
110881	You really messed that up something bad.
110883	Yo! How you doin'?
110884	Come on in and hang out.
110885	Oh, hey! Everything cool?
110886	Ah, real glad you dropped by.
110887	Come on in and chill a bit.
110888	Wow, look who came in out of the cold!
110891	Hey! Thanks for coming over!
110892	There's some serious winter out there! Why don't you come in here and thaw.
110893	Sure thing!
110894	No problemo.
110895	Sure, no prob.
110896	Like, for sure.
110897	Sure, happy to.
110899	Admit it, you knew I'd say yes.
110900	For you? Like, you had to ask? Sure.
110901	No biggie! Leave it to me!
110902	Sure, you don't have to ask twice.
110903	Sorry, nope, not goin' there.
110905	What? No way.
110906	Uh-uh, no can do.
110907	Not gonna happen.
110908	You know I gotta say no.
110909	Sorry, can't help you there.
110910	No way, not even for you.
110911	Whoa, you know, this kinda comes at an inconvenient time!
110912	Um... I'm don't think I'm the right one to ask. Sorry!
110914	Hey. Could you gimme a hand?
110915	Hate to ask, but I'm in a squeeze, know what I mean?
110916	I could really use your help here.
110917	My talents lie in a different field, but maybe you can do better?
110919	I am not sure I got this right. Could you maybe figure it out?
110918	Can I get you on board for that? Would be cool to have some back-up!
110921	Oh hey. Since you're here, wanna take care of something for me?
110922	Didn't expect to see you out here. Help me out?
110923	Good thing I ran into you. Do me a solid?
110924	Am I glad I ran into you. There's, like, this problem that came up...
110925	Wow, you're here too? Cool! Hope you got time to help a buddy.
110926	It's a small world for reals! Say, you familiar with stuff like this?
110927	I knew you'd do it!
110928	Wow! Awesome job!
110929	That was extreme! Like, awesome!
110930	Crazy job! Sweet!
110931	I knew you were the right one to ask!
110932	Incredibly, awesomely cool. Like… yeah.
110933	Now, that's the way to kick it!
110934	You did great!
110935	Gotta admit, not your A-game today.
110936	Hey, what can you do? Circumstances and stuff …
110937	Did I throw you in over your head? Sorry...
113441	Um... sure, I'll get along. Somehow.
113442	If you gotta go, you gotta go.
113443	No way I can change your mind? No? Okay...
110938	Not pushin' or nothin', but how you doin' on that job?
110939	Sure, take your time. Just wanted to ask how you're doing...
110940	Sorry, kinda lost track of things. How far you got?
110941	You don't have to, like, make reports and stuff. I'm just curious how it's gettin' along.
110942	You're not leavin' me high and dry with that, are you? You won't, right?
110943	Um… Hope you're good with that assignment I gave you.
110944	Sorry if I sound all wound, but I need that job finished.
110945	Got any news on that job for me? Just askin'.
110946	Yeah, that's exactly the one I meant!
110947	Uh-huh, that thing!
110948	That's the stuff I told you about.
110949	Bingo! That's the one.
110950	Cool, you found it!
110951	Nice work, Sherlock!
110952	Looks like you've got it!
110953	Um... wait... Yeah, that's the right one.
110954	Yeah, that's the spot.
110955	Never have to ask directions, huh?
110956	Over here, keep movin'!
110957	Yeah, that's where you gotta go.
110958	Yeah! Dead on!
110960	That's where I meant.
110962	You're pretty good at the whole navigation thing!
110963	Woah, sorry, kinda forgot. There's still something else needs to be done.
110964	Cool. There any chance you might help me with something else?
110965	You walked that one! Up for another?
110966	Look, I got a job, but it might get kinda violent, you know?
110967	Um, look, I'd go myself, but all the noise and shootin' and stuff …
110968	This whole military bit isn't exactly my thing. Would you like to take over?
110969	I could really use your help, but I gotta warn you. People are gonna be shooting at you.
110970	Look, I'm no good with guns. Mind taking the field for me?
110971	You are badass!
110972	Talk about droppin' the hammer!
110973	Know what? That was scary.
116040	Thanks for retaking the Climate Stabilizers for us. Really appreciate that!
116041	You're someone a guy can count on, for sure. Without you, those terrorists would still be in charge around here!
116042	Ah… The climate here has stabilized again. I really owe you one.
110974	Sorry I talked you into that. At least they didn't get you.
110975	You got your ass whooped out there.
110976	Just look at the bright side. You're not dead.
116043	Aw, rats! So close! Almost got those Stabilizers back!
116044	At least you tried. There were a lot of guns on those ships...
116045	Hope you're okay... those terrorists will stop at nothing to keep our Stabilizers under their control.
110977	Come on in. Got some good stuff here!
110978	Got a new load of some really cool stuff. Come on in!
110979	Hi! Looking for the treasures of the Arctic? Got them all!
110980	I'm gonna make you a good price, okay?
110981	Check out my catalogs. If somethin' catches your eye, lemme know.
110982	Welcome to Jorgensen Super Regional! Lookin' for anything special?
110983	If you wanna buy, I wanna sell.
110984	Oh, hey, need something specific?
110985	Hmm, good choice.
110986	Anything else you need?
110987	Thanks for supportin' my little enterprise here.
110988	Goods are on their way! Thanks a bunch!
110989	Okay, deal!
110990	Sure, it's yours!
110991	Happy doin' business with you!
110992	Good deal! Come back anytime.
110993	Okay, I'll send it to you.
110994	You know how to trade!
110995	Hot damn! Sweet price.
110996	No way I can turn that down!
110997	What a deal!
110998	You got yourself a deal.
110999	Good stuff. I'll take it.
111001	Cool. Deal.
111002	I'd be brain dead if I said no.
111003	Love the price. Deal.
111004	Fair price. I'll take it.
111005	I like to carry a bit of everything, you know?
111006	I have been trying to get my hands on one of those meteorite fragments. Space rocks aren't really my thing, but I've met someone... and, well, it'd be the perfect gift!
111007	I really do like the whole trading thing. But it would be nice to go out every once in a while too... Whatever, the other Custodians will warm to me eventually.
111008	Away from the poles, people always talk about our endless winters. But we've got endless summers too! Then again... they don't really balance. I've lived here all my live and I still dread all that darkness.
111009	This is so cool! Buy some stuff, sell some stuff, meet new people… Tough life, man, tough life.
111010	I'm glad you're here! Just... generally! Okay, that's creepy. I mean, my people don't like outsiders much. I don't really get it. Why would you want to see the same faces and the same scenery for the rest of your life?
111011	Man, if you really need it, just ask a trader. It's what we do.
111012	Historically, cultural exchange and new perspectives and fresh ideas... it all came from trade, right? Okay, nowadays it's mostly lots and lots of unstaffed ships, but sometimes there's people like you!
111013	Man, I wonder why so many people are so uptight.
111014	Things'd be much more relaxed if people would just chill and talk, know what I mean?
111015	Live and let live, that's my motto.
111016	People say I'm soft because I'd rather be in here where it's warm. Whatever.
111017	It's mostly number crunching and waving ships through. But I do meet a lot of cool people, including you, of course.
111018	Helping one another is just another form of trading, you know?
111019	Life is so much better when you lay back and let it happen, man.
111020	I love it out here, man. A little cold, but that's cool.
113444	Not very sneaky. Just sayin', you know?
113445	Guess you're too honest to be a sneak.
113446	Busted!
113447	That's the right area, keep looking!
113448	Gotta be around there somewhere.
113449	Almost there. Look closer!
113450	That's it!
113451	You got it!
113452	You found it!
114981	Finally, a new face around here! Ville Jorgensen. Nice to meet you! In case you're looking for an arctic trading partner, here I am... At least consider it, okay?
115678	Don't let Dr. Grumpy put you off. I'm Ville Jorgensen. I'd be glad to do business with you. Just come on by, I have a warehouse in this sector.
115679	Yo, sorry my colleagues are kinda giving you the cold shoulder. Ville Jorgensen, nice to meet you! I run a trading post here, but business... yeah, just consider dropping by, okay? Please.
115680	Whoa, is that a customer? Yo, um... welcome to Jorgensen Super Regional. I'm Ville. Finest wholesale trader in the area. Have a look at my catalog!
115681	You came! Well, welcome to Jorgensen Super Regional. Goods, stuff, technology. Whatever you're looking for, I have it... probably!
115682	Yo! You're really expanding! Hope my branch office in this sector sees some activity now!
115683	May I do some shameless self-advertising? Got a trading post in this sector, too. Please stop by, okay...
115684	Cool, you're here, too! Then you can pop over to my local warehouse, if it's no trouble.
115685	Yo, have you made up your mind about doing business with me?
115686	Don't know if I told you, but I have this warehouse here. We could do some business.
115687	Any chance you and I could do some trading? Please?
115688	Yo, fancy doing Assignments for some of my other customers? They're waiting...
115689	Hey! Things have been busy since you showed up. Got a bunch of paying Assigments coming in for you.
115690	A company should never be short of Assignments. I could help you get some.
115880	Yo, heard the news! That's so cool! And I worked with you!
115857	Hello. Do you read me? Please come in.
115856	I'm Zandra Haynes, Sorry to invade your territory, but as I see it, we have the same enemy. I speak for the Lunar Excavation Corp. If you still acknowledge it.
115858	If you allow us to stay, I can sell you the remaining stock from the LEC warehouses. We won't bother you, you have my word.
115960	Don't let them get you. Full speed ahead!
115859	A fusion energy reactor? True, the LEC did research on that. But after Virgil Drake took over, the data disappeared from all LEC servers. Don't know what he plans to do with it.
115861	Oh, one piece of advice: Drake is capable of anything. You should increase your security level. We should have.
115959	Yeah, that looks like the LEC fusion research data. Well, as far as I can tell, anyway.
116355	Those are fusion weapons. I'd heard that Drake was up to something like that.
116356	He wants to arm the Moon with them so it has a military advantage over Earth. He calls that "equal opportunity".
116357	I know for sure he doesn't produce those weapons here. That wouldn't have slipped past my spies.
115378	New fugitives are heading to the camp! Lend me a hand here!
115379	Come over! There are new problems we have to tackle!
115380	We have to get going! There's no time to lose!
115381	Hello? Are you there? Meet me outside your settlement!
115382	Don't ignore us! We need your help!
115383	Just listen to what I have to say! Not for me, for my people!
114959	Thanks. Look, I don't have much time. The Orbital Watch is already on our trail.
114960	Since they took over, they hunt down anyone, who doesn't accept their authority. Many people have been driven out of their homes. And that's synonymous to a death sentence here.
114961	I know you're in a position to help those people. To provide them shelter. Please, don't let them down.
115237	News of this safe haven are spreading. Even the hesitant are willing to take a chance to escape, now that they have a place to head to. I'll let you know when more refugees arrive.
115238	The people in the camp are well supplied. I'll let you know when there are new arrivals.
115246	You saved many lives. And the more refugees we gather here, the more the Orbital Watch's foundation will crumble. I'll spread the word.
116341	I hear there are new refugee columns forming as we speak. I'll let you know when they arrive.
115247	Okay, bring them in and we'll assign them a nice clean home. And... wait, what's that?
115248	The disease is under control. And our guards are watching the borders at all times now. The people here have endured the worst, but you gave them new life, new hope.
116312	Hello... Oh, finally... listen, I... I don't know where else to send them! You must help them! There are lives at stake! I will repay you, I promise.
116313	All those people would be dead now, if it wasn't for you. We'll do our best to reciprocate! I promise, everyone here will pitch in to help.
116342	Quarantine the area! No one leaves their homes! This is a medical emergency! We have to enact countermeasures!
115797	Look, I don't know you, but I'm going to assume you're preferable to Virgil Drake. I'm Zandra Haynes. You could say I'm in charge of what remains of the Lunar Excavation Corp. If you want to trade goods, get in touch.
115798	Glad we found you. There are only few LEC colonies not controlled by the Orbital Watch. I can sell you the remaining stock from our warehouses and use the credits to buy supplies. I'd appreciate the business.
115799	You're not with them. Otherwise you'd know my face. Zandra Haynes. And I speak for the Lunar Excavation Corp. Provided you still acknowledge it.
115800	I hope no one followed you. Here, that's all that remains of the LEC stock. And it's all for sale.
115801	I'm always on the move, supplying the LEC colonies still resisting the Orbital Watch. You want to help supply them, too? Then trade with me here.
115802	Glad you're founding more colonies out here. Safe stopovers for our convoys. Plus, you can always trade with us whenever we're here.
115803	I'm glad we're not on our own. But I really can't offer you any more than the remnants from the LEC warehouses. If you want to trade, I'll be here.
110508	That's good.
110509	As good as it gets, I guess.
110510	More of that'd be OK.
110511	Good news for a change, huh?
110512	Not bad.
110513	Reason to hope.
110514	I feel better.
110515	Hmm, useful.
110516	If only it always went like this.
110517	Couldn't have expected anything better.
110518	I thought it'd always stay like this.
110519	That eases our load a little.
110520	That's something off my shoulders.
110521	That helps.
110522	Thanks.
110523	Good move.
110524	You did us a favor.
110525	At least we can rely on you.
110526	I don't know where we would be now, if it wasn't for you.
110527	Huh, today can still turn into a good day, thanks.
110528	I respect you, you should know that.
110529	Thanks for your support.
110530	I hear good things about you.
110531	Not helpful.
110532	Could things get any worse?
110533	Ahhhh... of course...
110534	Life goes on. Has to.
110535	There's never a shortage of bad news.
110536	Why now?
110537	Please no.
110538	As if there wasn't enough crap going on up here.
110539	Well, what use is complaining?
110540	Bad news always travels fast.
110541	You have any idea what that means for us?
110542	It's stuff like that that will end us.
110543	I'm straining to keep things together and you... bah...
110544	What was that for?
110545	I can't believe you let that happen.
110546	Say, whose side are you on?
110547	Just forget it.
110548	Oh no, you didn't...
110549	Hard to make a difference here, huh?
110550	Just trying isn't enough, you know...
110551	Huh, a friendly face.
110552	How am I? Surviving.
110553	I hope nobody followed you.
110555	Not a word about this place; right?
110560	You can't stay long. We have to keep moving.
110561	This place is a mess, I know. But it's all we have left.
110562	Hey there, everything all right?
110563	Be honest. How bad is it out there?
110564	Tell me you've got good news.
110565	I'm glad you made it.
110566	We do what we can.
110570	We just have to try.
110571	We'll get started on it.
110572	Some things must be done.
110575	It won't hurt, I guess.
110577	My word's my word!
110578	Sure. Hope I can count on you too.
110579	I'll try. But I really can't promise anything.
110580	I'll take the risk.
110581	I will.
110582	No. I have reasons.
110583	That would attract too much attention.
110584	I don't have the resources.
110585	Not a chance.
110586	Can't right now.
110587	And how do you picture that?
110588	You know our situation. .
110589	You know I would. If things were better.
110590	Why are you asking? It's obvious, I can't.
110591	I can't, and you know it.
110592	You're alone? Good. Here's what I want.
110593	Good you contacted me. Things are bad here.
110594	Thank goodness, you came. We can't cope with that.
110595	We can use all the help we can get.
110596	This will affect you as much as it affects us. Will you step in?
110597	This situation could break our backs. We really need your support.
110598	Please. There's no one else I can to turn to.
110599	I can't stay long. So, make your choice quickly.
110600	We aren't equipped for this. That's why I came to you.
110601	I mustn't be seen or they'll know I asked you.
110602	Good I found you. Please, this is important!
110603	It was tough getting here. I hope it wasn't for nothing.
110604	You saved our lives!
110606	It's early days yet, but I think it's really helped!
110607	You really stood up for us.
110618	You've done a lot for us. Thanks.
110619	Thanks. That means a lot.
110620	We won't forget that.
110621	I wish we could give more in return.
110622	We thank you.
110623	Why should things ever get better?
110624	Good thing we're used to disappointments.
110625	That's bad. But we have to carry on.
110626	We pinned our hopes on you.
110627	So, you're giving up?
110628	It's easy to let someone down when they're already on the bottom, huh?
110630	I'm relying on you here, you know.
110631	This is important, and not just for us.
110632	Tell me, what's the status out there?
110633	Come on, now. This can't wait forever.
110634	I hope the Orbital Watch doesn't find out what we're up to.
110635	You're our only hope, you know that.
110636	You haven't given up on us, have you?
110637	Is there still hope?
110668	Positive. That's it.
110669	I know one when I see one.
110680	That should be it.
110691	Handle it carefully.
110702	That's what you were searching for, right?
110713	You found it.
110724	Check.
110735	It's the right one.
110736	You're right on track.
110737	That is the place.
110738	Trust me, I know this area.
110739	Well, let's go!
110740	The nav system points there.
110741	No doubt, there it is.
110742	Careful when you approach.
110743	This is where you have to go.
110744	Thank you but there's something else…
110745	Problems are piling up here... we need still need your help.
110746	Now that is dealt with, we need your support more than ever.
110747	We are not equipped to deal with this kind of a threat!
110748	It's a matter of life and death!
110749	They are closing in on us! Please, help!
110750	All the endless violence. Something must be done.
110751	We tried to fight back... But we don't have your options!
110752	You brought us peace. Thank you.
110753	They are not invincible. You have proven that.
110754	The feeling of victory. Unfamiliar for us.
110755	Good to have you back in one piece, I guess.
110756	I understand what you must've been through.
110757	We've lost the battle, but we will not stop fighting.
110758	They know my face. It would be too dangerous to our cause if I were to do it myself.
110759	The Orbital Watch is on my tail. But someone has to take care of this!
110760	Please, many lives depend on this.
110761	The Orbital Watch is tightening the noose around us. Can I entrust you with this.
110762	There's always hope. You've shown us that.
110763	You enable us to keep up the resistance.
110764	Virgil Drake might be one step ahead of us. But he's more than one step behind you.
110765	That's a heavy setback!
110766	We won't recover from that so easily.
110767	I really thought you could at least make a difference.
110768	Damn. They spotted us!
110769	See. Not easy to keep a low profile.
110770	And back to hiding.
110791	Almost there.
110792	It's nearby. Stay on your guard.
110793	Just a short way to go.
110794	Ah, there is it.
110795	You're always keeping track, right?
110796	Search successful.
110797	All that's left of the LEC.
110798	I just might have what you need.
110799	Look first. Then we'll talk.
110800	You want something? Let's see what I got.
110801	I know, my product range could be broader...
110802	A few containers remained here. Feel free to browse.
110803	Welcome to our secret warehouse. Help yourself.
110804	Moon goods, huh? There might be something left.
110805	Good choice!
110806	Remember, you didn't get that from me.
110807	Thank you. We can use the money.
110808	Thanks. But don't expect a receipt.
110809	One hand washes the other.
110810	Thanks for supporting us.
110811	It's yours.
110812	Make sure you don't give us away.
110813	Good thing that's off my hands.
110814	Hot merchandise, be careful.
110815	I was looking for this, thanks.
110816	You have no idea how badly we need something like that.
110817	It's hard for us to get these things.
110818	This will be helpful.
110819	Had to buy it.
110820	Fair price. Even we can afford that.
110821	Will come in handy someday, I'm sure.
110822	Hope I can get it past the Orbital Watch.
110823	I'll take it right away.
110824	Finally, I got one. Thanks.
110826	I despise those terrorists! But their hate... That doesn't surprise me. You Earthlings take it all for granted. That we always deliver on time. People aren't just numbers on a spreadsheet, you know.
110827	Beauty of nature? Look, I grew up here. I don't care about your forests or valleys or beaches. We seek beauty in people, not in the landscape.
110828	Virgil Drake... he was in the LEC's middle management before, I hear. Paper-pusher turned extremist. Wouldn't be the first time.
110829	Many moon natives aren't exactly happy about the arrival of the Second Wave. But if the Orbital Watch is the alternative, I'd join forces with you any day.
110830	Mobility. That's our strongest weapon against the Orbital Watch. Our resistance may be scattered. But don't think we are not united.
110831	Even in my cargo delivery days, I didn't spend this much time on the road. Or should I say: On the run.
110832	My spies told me, Drake has some serious health problems. Maybe that's what it's really about... putting your mark on the Moon before it's all over.
110833	Don't think these corporations are totally innocent. The Ministry of Orbital Affairs never cared for the problems here, just for the results. And you see the results.
110834	The Orbital Watch stop at nothing. Terrorists attack oxygen tanks and supply convoys, strangling people into submission.... So many dead, still floating around somewhere in their space suits.
110836	It's not that I decided to be the head of the resistance. It's just that I have a fleet of transporters and a lot of fugitives who need passage and sustenance.
114982	I don't know you, but we seem to have the same enemy. I'm Zandra Haynes., and I speak for the Lunar Excavation Corp. Provided you still acknowledge it. Maybe we can help each other out with goods.
115804	My people can use every credit and every crate of goods. Come by my camp if you have something to spare.
115805	I know we can't give much. But we will be satisfied with whatever we can get. Just one deal, okay?
115806	These people are relying on me to supply them. Doing business with me won't hurt you.
115807	No idea why people come to me when they want to offer you Assignments. See for yourself.
115808	People still occasionally contact the LEC with Assigments. You should accept them. They sure are profitable.
115809	The Orbital Watch is a threat to every moon dweller. We should all work together. Check my camp for assignments.
115881	You didn't ignore us when we needed help. Congratulations! You earned it.
115898	What? Jorgensen! I was clear about this! No outside involvement!
115767	Of course they're off-limits to you.
115768	So, you have arrived.
115763	I'm Dr. Howard Young. I speak for the Arctic Custodians.
115764	First allow me to be clear: We expect you to abide by our directives at all times. The Arctic ecosystem is very delicate.
115765	Concerning your recent... military involvement. We would prefer that you pursue such destructive activities outside our territory.
115766	A good day to you.
116316	Don't interfere with Arctic Custodian duties.
116318	Respect these rules and we'll get along just fine.
115769	And don't overfish!
115770	Fine. Your settlement seems to follow our regulations well enough. You are permitted to continue the expansion of your spaceport. Within reasonable limits.
115771	The Arctic Custodians will provide you with the technology required to establish an icebreaker dock here. Handle it with care.
115772	A few weather anomalies. Nothing we can't deal with. Enact stabilization protocol 16.3.
115773	What... why...
115774	Systems not responding! Stabilisation values approaching critical level.
115775	Storms on our borders. Around the entire Arctic Circle. Do they... do they want to isolate us completely?
115776	What… someone has taken over control of the Stabilizers?
115778	You are responsible for this! It's the Lunar Licensing Program that brought those terrorists here! Consider our support suspended! And keep out of our affairs!
105605	I must admit, I underestimated you. My apologies. Be assured we will support you in your endeavours.
116331	They have the whole Climate Stabilizer network under their control!
116332	The temperatures are rising. Higher and higher. This will lead to a catastrophe!
116333	We have to stop it! The snow will melt, the icesheet will break apart, the glaciers...
115955	There you are. Not a minute too early. The Orbital Watch... They've brought in everything at their disposal!
115956	A whole fleet is steaming toward us! They've got ships that resemble floating fortresses! Nearly indestructible.
115957	They've cut a swathe of devastation through our protectorates. You're our only hope.
115958	I know why Drake attacked us. It's because we don't have any defensive measures to speak of. And our scouts have already detected another wave heading in our direction. I hope we can call on you again.
115371	The project's moving again! Come over!
115372	I could use a helping hand with our project.
115373	About our project. I guess you're needed again!
115374	You mind helping me out a little? It's something big.
115375	Don't mean to hassle you. But could you drop by sometime?
115376	I need your help here. Could you come by and have a look?
114899	It was irresponsible of you to meddle with our Climate Stabilizers without asking us. But the situation has been exacerbated, and I must say I don't see Mr. Jorgensen handling it on his own.
114900	And please remind Mr. Jorgensen not to be so careless in the future. I hate to think of what the Orbital Watch could do with our technology.
114901	You have made a substantial contribution towards maintaining Earth's climatic stability. We are not unthankful. So, if you would like some specific changes in the local weather for your benefit, you may ask.
114949	Hmm, everything seems to be in line here. Please proceed with dismantling the oil platform.
114950	Thank you for informing me. This oil rig is indeed in critical condition. You are authorized to access it and take the necessary countermeasures.
115262	Good, I see you're on-site. Now we can examine the oil leakage in this sector. All oil rig pumps to full power!
114951	It could have developed into a full-scale catastrophe. Thankfully, there are still people who are aware of their responsibility to our planet. People like you.
115527	I have to warn you. Forcing your way straight through will destabilize the whole area.
115529	This is a clear violation of regulations! This project is no longer backed by the Arctic Custodians!
116053	The Orbital Watch is staging a full-scale offensive against our settlements. We don't have a navy to speak of, while they have batteships like none I've never seen before. Help us!
116054	Their attack waves refuse to ebb. We can't hold out any longer against their battleships. The fate of the Arctic Custodians is at stake.
116055	They know we have no means to defend ourselves. And still they threaten us with wave after wave of battleships. We are fully dependent on you for support here.
116062	The next confrontation is inevitable! Prepare yourself!
116063	It isn't over yet! The next dreadnought is drawing near!
116064	There is another one coming! Hold it back! Just... hold it back!
116065	It's them! Prepare yourself!
116066	Stop them!
116067	Don't back off from them!
109099	Good.
109100	Finally.
109101	Glad that's done.
109102	Happy that's out of the way.
109103	One problem less.
109104	Glad that's resolved.
109105	One less danger.
109106	Today is a good day.
109107	Better.
109108	A satisfactory outcome.
109109	Comforting.
109110	Much better.
109111	That's a relief.
109112	You did fine, I must admit.
109113	Credit where credit's due. You did well.
109114	I have to admit, you fulfilled your duties.
109115	That was wise of you.
109116	You did better than I thought.
109117	Yes, you did well enough.
109118	Good job. Maybe I was wrong about you.
109119	You surprised me. Positively.
109120	You did a good thing today.
109121	You did a good job this time.
109122	Nothing short of a disaster.
109123	About what I expected.
109124	Terrible.
109125	Very disturbing.
109126	Not helpful.
109127	This is dangerous.
109128	More for us to worry about.
109129	Hopefully that won't set a precedent.
109130	Atrocious.
109131	Disastrous.
109132	That's what carelessness brings about.
109133	That's what happens when you don't pay attention.
109134	Now look what you've done.
109135	You're always blind to the consequences of such actions.
109136	You do know the damage this is going to cause, don't you?
109137	I expected you to be careless, but this careless...
109138	How typical of you.
109139	Should have known you'd... never mind.
109140	If you don't plan on being considerate, don't even bother.
109141	I shouldn't have asked you in the first place...
109142	Yes?
109143	What is it?
109144	What do you want?
109145	Hello.
109146	Hmm?
109147	What brings you here?
109148	Why are you bothering me?
109149	I hope it's important.
109150	Say what you need to say.
109151	Speak.
109152	I shall look into it.
109153	I suppose.
109154	Agreed.
109155	Very well.
109156	Alright.
109157	In this case, I'm with you.
109158	Okay, I'll give it a chance.
109159	Alright, let's see what I can do.
109160	Fine, I'll do it.
109161	Okay, but I'll be expecting results.
109162	No.
109163	Forget it.
109164	Not going to happen.
109165	Never.
109166	Absolutely not.
109167	I will not. And you shouldn't either.
109168	No. I'm surprised you even asked.
109169	You can't be serious.
109170	You know my viewpoint. No.
109171	Your request is unacceptable.
109172	Not for me. For the good of the planet.
109173	This is your department. Not ours.
109174	You could do something of relevance.
109175	This is of the utmost importance.
109176	Take it or leave it. But it is an opportunity.
109177	You wish to convince us of your reliability. Then walk the walk.
109178	You have set a fine example.
109179	Finally you're taking a stand for a worthy cause!
109180	You surprise me. That was well done.
109181	In all honesty, you did very well.
109182	It seems you do understand. Good.
109183	I'm seldom wrong about people. But in your case...
109184	You reveal unexpected qualities, I must say.
109185	Nothing to complain about. Good.
109186	At least you haven't wrought too much havoc.
109187	Well, what did I expect?
109188	You've done enough. We'd better take over from here.
113530	You carry a great responsibility.
113531	Do I have to remind you of your duties?
113532	I take you at your word.
113533	It is necessary.
113534	Please, adhere to our guidelines, while you do it.
113535	I'm waiting.
113536	If you're here, who's out dealing with the problem?
113537	Please, keep it in mind.
113453	I hadn't thought you'd be the kind to abandon projects.
113454	I think you're setting false priorities.
113455	Tenacity is its own reward. Although not for you, I see.
109189	There.
109190	That one.
109191	What? Yes, that.
109192	So you're not blind, after all.
109193	Yeah, that's the one.
109194	Good. That's it.
109195	Well, that's one step further than I thought you'd get.
109196	Exactly.
109197	This way.
109198	Now head over there.
109199	It's there. Can't you see?
109200	Yeah, there. Now, hurry.
109201	Stop wasting time and go.
109202	Indeed, it's here.
109203	Please go there immediately.
113539	Don't take too much time.
109204	The problem is proving more convoluted than I anticipated.
109205	So, you completed the preliminaries. Now on to the next steps.
109206	You should be familiar with the problem now. Ready to carry on?
109207	Those terrorists are a danger. And not only to us.
109208	You'll need all the forces you can muster. This will be dangerous.
109209	You will need to be careful. These people are "shoot first, forget the questions“.
109210	We don't normally resort to violence. But this time, I give you explicit consent.
109211	We don't have the military means to deal with this. It might be different a matter for you.
109212	You have fought off disaster. I must thank you.
109213	You defused an ugly situation. Many thanks.
109214	The damage could have been much greater. You have my thanks.
116056	I must thank you. Without you, there would be nothing left of our protectorates.
116057	You are the most reliable ally we have against those madmen. I don't know why I didn't realize that earlier.
116058	It's over for now. But this is only the calm before the next storm. I hope we can count on you when the time draws nigh.
109215	One should think that if you use violence, it should make a difference.
109216	An environmental nightmare, and all for nothing.
109217	The wounded were recovered. That's the best I can say about the situation.
116059	A catastrophe. I must evacuate our nearby settlements immediately. I hope we'll get the opportunity to drive them off in the future.
116060	Our hopes were in vain. But as long as there is but a tinge of white on the glaciers, we will return to fight!
116061	So much sorrow, so much death. What are those terrorists after...
109218	We all play a part in the preservation of the arctic. Including you.
109219	Future generations will thank you.
109220	People like you are responsible for the current situation.
109221	I hold no grudge against the poachers who killed my father. I did when I was a boy of seventeen. But in time, I realized something. When you grow up in a society that defines itself through taking, having, hoarding... It becomes natural to brutalize your fellow men and be brutalized by them.
109222	There have been efforts to allow pets on the Moon. Hardly a fitting environment. Oh, that reminds me, I need to buy more dog food for Haluuq... I hope he's behaving himself while I'm away.
109223	The Arctic Custodians are here to protect treasures most people don't even know exist. Treasures like the chance to live on a healthy, habitable planet.
109224	It's not that I oppose the Lunar Licensing Program. It is just that I'm not a friend of knee-jerk actions. But maybe the corporation simply lacks experience in long-term development. Well, we've been around longer than they have.
109225	It's a constant struggle to protect our arctic preserve against the rapacious maws of big business. I wish the corporation would provide us more support, but they're too busy fishing for voters.
109226	The only thing more amazing than human greed is their unreasoning belief that they have a right to that greed. The Big Five are well-versed in this line of thought.
109227	The Arctic Custodians are mankind's environmental conscience. It's no wonder we're unpopular.
109228	Just a few of days ago, we were contacted by someone. She refuses to give her real name, so I'll refuse to accept her messages as anything other than manipulation.
109229	Earth is like a greenhouse. To protect the life inside, all of the conditions must be balanced with the greatest of care. But the Big Five prefer to throw stones.
109230	I'm often considered gruff or taciturn. I just don't suffer fools lightly.
109231	If only people would think. My apologies, I am not usually given to flights of fantasy.
109232	Possessions do not make one rich. That which one experiences makes one rich.
109233	Out here, one has time to think, to reflect. An incalculable treasure. I wish Jorgenson would embrace that. It might even cure his constant fidgeting.
109234	It is impossible to put a price on the peace and beauty the arctic has to offer. The Big Five have trouble accepting that.
109235	I will never forget the first time I saw a harp seal come up to breathe through a hole in the ice. A beautiful moment.
109236	How can anyone see this place and not fall in love? A rhetorical question, of course. It's not like the Big Five would even give a moment's thought as to what they're exploiting.
109237	It's Earth Day. Please, be responsible. We only have one Earth.
113456	A hunter survives by not being seen.
113457	You must learn to be nothing more than the snow around you.
113458	An opportunity lost.
113459	Quiet now, you're getting close.
113460	Now keep your eyes open. You're close…
113461	You're close, now, very close. Look carefully.
113462	You learn the way of the hunt quickly.
113463	You did well.
113464	Good job. Maybe you do belong here, after all.
113540	Don't you dare touch anything!
113541	It's very delicate technology. You shouldn't even be here.
113542	Any careless touch of a button could lead to a disaster. You better go.
113543	You may build your facility here. And only here.
113544	I hope you've read our building regulations.
113545	This building plot is at your disposal. But don't overdo it.
113546	Oh, yes. Please, do come in!
113547	You see, the stabilizer network runs smoothly.
113548	Aren't they an engineering marvel?
113549	This building space is assigned only to you.
113550	Please, feel free.
113551	Take it. I have complete confidence in you.
115068	So, you've arrived. I'm Dr. Howard Young. First off, let me remind you to obey to our guidelines at all times. I don't want incidents like the sabotage at your headquarters to repeat themselves here.
115882	We've had our difficulties in the past. But I would like to congratulate you in all sincerity.
115931	Intruders! All ships, fire at will!
115932	Battle stations! Block all passages! Don't let anyone escape!
115933	What, how did you find... never mind, you won't live to tell anyone else...
115934	Oh, we have a visitor. All ships, battle stations! Show them what good hosts we are!
115935	Fusion energy can be a highly destructive force and we are on the verge of a breakthrough. Too bad you won't live to witness the first field test.
115936	All ships to alpha sector! Maximum security level!
115937	Weapons free! No prisoners!
115938	They're in our system! Run the security protocols!
115943	Show no hesitation! They... they cannot... just stop them!
115944	Fine. But we will have our revenge... you will see, you will see.
115945	Our... our data. I swear you will get what you deserve. I will see to it personally.
115946	Damn... now hurry! Show no mercy!
115947	All we asked for was respect... but you...  You prefer to treat us the way you've always treated us. Good, we've prepared for this eventuality.
115948	Don't try to negotiate with us. You forfeited that right the moment your shuttles took off. And now you shall have our response.
115949	Hmmm, you have prevailed. But that was just one of them...
115950	This one is just for you.
115951	Stop acting so tough! You'll have nothing by the next wave!
115952	Attack!
115953	No mercy!
115915	You don't want to understand! We refuse to live by the corporations' laws any longer! You have no right to be here!
115916	I have never been averse to a diplomatic solution. But if you don't want to accept our terms, I'll let our weapons do the talking!
115917	You have the nerve to challenge us in our own territory? Fine. You shall learn that it is better not to ignore my warnings!
115919	Don't get used to them. They'll be ruins soon enough.
115920	Don't let them get away! Fire at will!
115921	You are sheltering a convicted traitor! Surrender her at once, or you will face the consequences!
115923	Fire! Fire!
115924	You're fraternizing with a traitor to our revolution. Prepare to face the consequences!
115925	Fire at will!
115927	So, you refuse to understand. Then you leave us no choice...
115928	Next time you won't see it coming!
115929	The energy crisis, oh yes. First the corporations bring Earth to the brink of a total blackout. Then they press the population of the Moon for a solution. And now they come to rob us of the fruits of our labor. But we will not allow that!
115930	You think you can simply lay claim to what we've compiled through years of research? Stealing the fruits of other peoples' labor is an action all too fitting for a Corporate stooge.
115954	You'll wish you'd never set foot in our territory. The First Wave will wash away the Second.
116346	Your shields might hold against meteors, but they will be powerless against what I'll be using out here.
116347	You will get your share of fusion energy. I'm sure it will be more than you can take.
116348	Everything I worked on! Gone!
116349	Don't you understand! This technology would have made us equal! Earth and Moon, evenly matched in war and peace. But that's what you fear, isn't it?
116350	Sacrifices must be made for the greater good. It's nothing personal.
116359	They just need a little fine calibration. A matter of time.
115902	People of Earth. This is the manifesto of the Moon's independence.
115903	The Global Union waged war on us for generations with weapons like falsehood, negligence and exploitation. And the LEC bowed its head in servile compliance.
115904	But not anymore. Set no foot on the land of our forefathers.
115905	We are the Orbital Watch. The Moon is free.
115907	It seems you've made a decision. We will show you that it wasn't wise.
120067	People of Earth. This is the manifesto of the Moon's independence.
120068	The Global Union has waged war on us for generations with weapons like falsehood, negligence and exploitation. And the LEC bowed its head in servile compliance.
120069	But not anymore. As the decendants of the First Wave of lunar colonization the time has come to take back what is rightfully ours. Set no foot on the land of our forefathers.
115908	You leave me no choice. You have rejected my offer of peace. I don't believe in second chances.
115909	Long ago, people believed that the Moon controlled the weather. We will prove them right.
115910	The climate. Earth's barely healed wound. Let's see what happens when I abrade it.
115911	You think this is victory? There's an entire network of Climate Stabilizers out there. We will strike again, when you least expect it.
115912	You may think you've won. But as long as you continue trying to invade our home, our attacks will not cease.
116334	Is it just me, or is it unusually warm for this time of year?
115913	What's one in a network of serveral hundred.
115914	Fine. Another one. But don't believe I'm going to let this happen again!
115249	You must understand that I cannot tolerate your providing Zandra Haynes and her radicals shelter. I've placed a few surprises in the area. See for yourself.
115252	Yes, yes, the sheep run back to those who once sheared them. Beware, the wolves are at the door.
115256	You won this time. We'll see how you do when I change the battlefield.
116343	Hygiene conditions in refugee camps are far from ideal, I suppose. Infection can spread easily through oxygen systems.
111825	Then make me!
111826	No! Stupid question.
111827	Of course not!
111828	Ridiculous. The answer is no.
111829	Forget it.
111830	You don't have the right to dictate anything.
111831	Do you even realize how ludicrous that is? No!
111832	You're mistaken if you think I will do anything for you.
111833	For you? No. Not a chance.
111834	No I don't think so. Not for you.
111835	You won't be able to stop us!
111836	This will give you a chance to see how futile you are.
111837	Let's see if you have what it takes.
111838	We'll soon see if you can walk the walk.
111839	You are free to face the challenge, if you dare.
111840	As easy as this task is, I don't really think you're up to it.
111841	One bad turn deserves another. You will see.
111842	That task was easy. A child could have done it.
111843	You'll soon see the cost of that.
111844	Remember, everything has a price. Your success here is no exception.
111845	I'll admit, I didn't think you could do it. Soon we'll see if you can pay the price.
111846	Don't believe for a minute you're getting off that easily.
111847	What you just did will cost you.
111848	You're going to regret that.
111849	Your failures are the soil upon which our freedom grows.
111850	Well, it's good to know you pose no serious danger.
111851	Oh my. And that was the best you could do? Ah ha ha ha ha...
111852	You are giving up? Wise of you.
111853	There's no shame in realizing you're outclassed. Well, not much.
111854	Time to run home to mummy?
111877	We should have hidden it better...
111878	I'm going to find the traitor that sold you its location...
111879	I knew I shouldn't have let the intern hide that...
111880	Oh, so the great detective finally found it, huh? Bravo!
111881	It was just too conspicuous.
111882	If you hadn't found that, I would have suggested eye surgery.
111883	Congratulations on your uncanny ability to find the blindingly obvious.
111884	Wow. Recognizing shapes must be your superpower, right?
111885	Then come. If you dare.
111886	Let's see if you'll show.
111887	Red rover, red rover, come on over.
111888	Come and get some.
111889	So now you know. Come...
111890	You know where to find us...
111891	Come and show me what you're made of.
111892	This is where we'll see just what you bring to the game.
111909	Turn back or face the consequences!
111910	Moving any closer could be hazardous to your health.
111911	I really think that is as close as you want to get.
111915	You thought you could remain unseen, on our land?
111916	Talk about the proverbial bull in a china shop!
111917	You sneak about as well as pigs fly!
111921	Did you think that was all we had?
111922	So, that was Round One. Are you ready for Round Two?
111923	Now that we're warmed up, it's time to get serious.
111927	You want war? You shall have it.
111928	Welcome to the arena. Time to see if you have what it takes.
111929	You talk a big game. Let's see if you have the muscle to back it up.
111930	Now we shall see whether you're a warrior or not.
111931	There will be fighting involved. I expect you'll enjoy that.
111932	Our counterstrike will be devastating!
111933	You will regret this day
111934	Today you have sealed your doom.
111935	So many lives. Senselessly sacrificed on the altar of your arrogance!
111936	Your overweening pride has cost many lives. I hope you're proud.
111937	I wonder what your people think when they see you throw their lives away so carelessly?
111938	Yours will follow soon enough.
111939	For that, you will pay!
111940	All ships sink eventually, as you shall soon learn.
111941	The ship was nothing, but the crew? For them, you will pay!
111942	Our revenge will be swift and terrible!
111943	It's just steel and concrete. Our morale is impossible to destroy.
111944	Never forget that buildings don't fire weapons.
111945	Nothing we can't rebuild.
111946	So, at least now we know you can hit things that don't move.
111947	Well, I guess it's a good thing we have more than one building, isn't it?
111948	Let's see if you have what it takes to get here.
111949	So you think you're big enough to do it, do you? We'll soon see about that!
111950	Aren't you biting off just a little more than you can chew?
111951	Impressive, isn't it? And all the more deadly.
111952	It's even more dangerous than it looks, as you'll soon find out.
111953	Good eye! Yes, that's the one you should run away from.
111954	This will be our final offensive! Soon your greedy, predatory colonies will lie in ruins!
111956	Defend yourself, if you can! The time has come for you to die!
111957	You came to crush the revolution, but now the tables are turned!
111958	You were given enough opportunities to join us. You refused, and now you will pay.
111959	These people, my people, have suffered too much for too long. It ends here!
111960	The next time you will fail.
111961	I wouldn't feel too safe just yet!
111962	You got lucky this time! I'll be back!
111963	This was just the opening move. The end game is yet to come!
111964	You've been lucky this time!
111965	The revolution has achieved a great victory! And you... you will perish!
111966	You never had anything to oppose us.
111967	You should have known you were out of your league.
111968	So now you know what happens to those who oppose the revolution!
111969	We want justice. This is what happens to those who oppose it.
111970	The Moon is now free! Gone, the days when the Big Five and their stooges preyed upon the land of our birth. We are the First Wave, and we will tolerate no second!
111971	The Big Five. Hah! Vultures trading human lives for profit. None of them gave a damn.
111972	So you're in tight with the masters, the Big Five. How's it feel to run with cowards and murderers?
111973	They always start out well-meaning. But then the money starts rolling in. And soon that's all that matters.
111974	Did anyone ever tell you about what happened at the Bainbridge Crater? I didn't think so. For years we demanded justice, but no! When they do finally remember us, all they do is send people like you. As if nothing ever happened!
111975	For years they just used us and threw us away as they fattened their wallets. Well, they're all going to pay now!
111976	It's so easy to just use people and dispose of them like garbage. If you don't believe me, just ask the LEC.
111977	Everybody needs something to believe in. For the corporations, it's profit. For us, it's… us.
111978	The Oppressors did not break me, the incident at the Bainbridge Crater did not break me, You think you can break me?
111979	Do you know what the LEC and their masters did? Did they tell you about sending people to their deaths just to increase their profits? Sending them to ice mines located in the middle of a radioactive waste deposit? I didn't think so!
111980	It's one of those things. No one's fault. Nothing can be proved. Platitudes! Excuses! They tried to destroy our lives! But now… now the shoe is on the other foot.
111981	You shouldn't have believed their lies. You should have at least heard our side of the story, but oh no… It's so much easier just to call us villains and terrorists.
111982	You know, nobody ever asks where the LEC got their money. I'll let you in on a little secret, though - they got it by murdering innocent miners and their families. Ask them.
111983	First Wave, Second Wave. Government meddling, faceless corporations and recklessness. I wonder will history repeat itself?
111984	Corporate perversion should have been a topic in history class. And "As ye sow, so shall ye reap."
111985	For the miners who died. For the loved ones who grieved. For the children lost and crying for their parents. The day of retribution is at hand. They will finally find peace.
113560	Already got enough?
113561	You think you can cope with me. Prove it.
113562	This is how far you've come? Ridiculous.
113563	Admit it, you have no chance.
113564	So?
113565	Just surrender and save us both the trouble.
111823	Alright. But don't forget this, I certainly won't.
111822	Very well. But remember, you owe me.
111824	I hate it when helping you is the lesser of two evils.
111820	You should not mistake my cooperation for a concession.
111692	It all unfolds.
111693	How… satisfying.
111694	So must it be.
111695	Yes, yes. Excellent.
111696	Exemplary.
111697	How very convenient.
111698	A satisfactory solution.
111699	That's the way it was supposed to end.
111700	Couldn't have turned out better.
111701	Good news. Definitely good news
111815	By necessity. Not by choice...
111816	Needs must.
111817	Very well - this time.
111818	What must be done, must be done.
111819	I will do it, but I don't have to like it.
111804	Did you come to negotiate your capitulation?
111805	Well, well. Look who's come to slum with the scum.
111806	So, have you come to your senses? Are you here to join us?
111807	What do you want?
111808	Fine. You're here. Say what you came to say.
111809	If you've come to join us, you are welcome. If not…
111810	Have you come to help us get our justice?
111811	So, tell me. Are you here to hear our side of the story?
111812	Oh, it's you. What do you want?
111813	I assume there's something you wish to discuss?
111794	This only delays your inevitable defeat.
111795	You are walking into the path of an avalanche.
111796	Congratulations. You have reached "inconvenience" status.
111797	You are becoming annoying.
111798	You don't actually believe that you can change anything, do you?
111799	You must know that resistance is futile.
111800	You seem to have a bad habit of messing things up.
111801	You might want to reconsider your options.
111802	I am not an uncivil man, but you are trying my patience.
111803	Try all you want. You cannot stop the revolution.
111715	This can't be true!
111716	No. NO!
111717	This is totally unacceptable.
111718	This cannot be allowed to interfere.
111720	This is disastrous.
111721	I cannot believe it.
111722	Oh, for the love of…
111723	Definitely a setback.
111724	This does not fit the plan.
111725	We cannot let this slow us down.
111705	Watch carefully. You can experience triumph vicariously.
111706	You see? That's how it's done.
111707	Don't worry. There are many things I can do that you cannot.
111708	I know. It's natural for you to be jealous.
111709	You see? Justice itself is on my side. We are invincible.
111710	How? It's easy when you're doing what's right.
111711	It's like taking candy from a baby. You lackeys should know all about that.
111712	Were you taking notes?
111713	I hope you were watching closely.
111714	Maybe, if you someday see the light, you'll be able to do that too.
111702	Now, the revolution can continue unabated!
111703	A burden lifted.
111704	Another yoke, removed from our necks!
115883	Well played. But the game is not over yet.
116070	You need those more than we do.
116071	No need to struggle.
116072	A small sacrifice.
116075	Aren't you well trained?
116076	No need for violence.
116077	You won't stop me.
116078	Do you ever question orders?
116079	Trust me, it's necessary.
116080	Don't run from the truth.
116081	Consider it a warning.
116082	It doesn't have to happen.
116083	You're not getting away.
116084	I can't guarantee what might happen.
116085	There's still time to turn back.
116086	Heed my words and get out.
116278	Lauren.
116279	It's sad how it's developed. The Global Union conjures an image of a united mankind. But the truth is: Earth is dependent on the Moon. And it gives nothing back.
116280	The Global Union does not own us. They founded the LEC long ago, yes. But the families of most of our members are third or fourth generation moon dwellers. Many have been here since the First Wave. The Corporation should respect our importance.
116281	Well, Climate Stabilizers are real power hogs. And the LEC is the only organization mining Helium-3. If the Global Union really wants to develop a fusion power station in the near future, they won’t have any choice but to deal with us.
116282	Just another example of how the Global Union is corrupted by the Big Five. They've always lusted after our territories.
116283	As I said, they won't have any choice but to deal with us.
116284	Goodbye.
109393	Now, how awesome was that?
109394	That was pretty cool.
109395	Good to hear.
109396	Alright!
109397	That's perfect!
109398	That's complete!
109399	Excellent.
109400	That's great!
109401	Wonderful news.
109402	Pretty awesome.
109403	Phew, finally... nice to have that problem off my mind.
109404	Okay, that doesn't impede us anymore.
109405	Changes like that are always welcome!
109406	You're a genius, you know that?
109407	That was a smart solution.
109408	You were brilliant!
109409	Resolution close to optimum!
109410	Wow! That's a clever approach!
109411	You did it and it worked perfectly.
109412	You did fantastic, you know that?
109413	A stroke of genius! Thank you!
109414	You really know what you're doing!
109415	You were awesome!
109417	Oh, no.
109418	Please tell me I didn't see that.
109419	That was bad.
109420	That, could have gone better.
109421	Murphy's Law.
109422	There's no way… What went wrong?
109423	That is just so wrong.
109424	Okay, that didn't turn out as expected.
109425	That's so not good.
109427	You hadn't thought that through, right?
109428	You didn't pay attention, huh?
109429	I know you're smarter than that.
109430	You know, you kind of let me down there.
109431	I really expected you to do better.
109432	Chaos theory. You can't control all parameters.
109434	I could give you a breakdown on what went wrong, but we both know, right?
109435	Let's just say you weren't at the top of your game, okay?
109436	I bet you feel badly about it too.
109437	Hey there... err, I mean... welcome to Ibarra-FoxCom!
109438	Who's… Uh, hi! What can I do for you?
109439	What brings you to Ibarra-FoxCom?
109440	Can't you see… Oh, sorry! I was just… I mean, uh, welcome!
109441	Hi! Um, could you wait just a… There. What can I do for you?
109442	Ibarra-FoxCom, Hofwegen. Oh, hi!
109443	Welcome! How are you today?
109444	So, what can I do for you? Sorry, that was rude of me. How are you?
109445	Hello! Good to see you.
109446	Huh? Oh, hi! Welcome to Ibarra-FoxCom!
109447	Already have something in mind.
109448	Sure, that's doable
109449	Logical request. Sure!
109450	That makes sense. Yes.
109451	I think that can be done.
109452	Sure! Ibarra-FoxCom would be glad to help you.
109453	Since you asked so nicely, sure!
109454	I think I can make that happen for you.
109455	Sure. You know Ibarra-FoxCom is all about helping one another.
109456	I'm sorry, what was that? Oh, sure, we can do that for you.
109457	My projections tell me to stay out of this.
109458	Sorry, got a lot on my mind right now.
109459	No, sorry.
109460	Sorry, but a quick analysis indicates that I should refuse.
109461	What gave you that idea? No.
109462	Sorry to disappoint you, but I have to say no.
109463	I wish we could help you. But as things are... sorry.
109464	Sorry, but I'm afraid we have to sit this one out.
109465	Sorry, but Ibarra-FoxCom can't help you.
109466	Please don't take this personally, but it's a no.
109467	Right on cue! Would you like to take part in one of our ventures?
109468	Hi! Look, there's been this development and we could use your help. Interested?
109469	Hey! Would you like to help me implement this?
109470	Hey there! Would you help me... err, Ibarra-Fox Com with this project?
109471	Funny, I was just thinking about you. I could use some help here, you know?
109472	I'm glad you're free! You see, we need this.
109473	I'm on research trip for the company. There's this amazing new project we've kicked off, are you interested?
109474	Oh, hey good to see you! I've been doing some on-site research for a project. Might be just your thing.
109475	What are you doing out here? Great to see you! Interested in a little project?
109476	I just need to get out of the lab every once in a while. Seeing as you're here, want to help me with something?
109477	Wow, am I glad I found you. I have a project that I think is right up your alley.
109478	Fancy meeting you out here! Say, would you be interested in taking on a project?
109479	Final results are in. And you did... wow!
109480	Congratulations! Your solution was close to optimal!
109481	Wow! You did an awesome job.
109482	You did great. The analysis is off the chart!
109483	You think outside the box! I like that!
109484	That was fascinating to see! Thank you so much!
109485	You figured it out! Great!
109486	You were awesome! Thank you!
109488	Unfavorable parameters. You tried your best.
109489	Everybody has their ups and downs.
109490	You win some, you lose some. That's science.
113477	Huh? Isn't my project interesting enough?
113478	Why are you breaking off? Did I miss something?
113479	I understand. Sometimes a new avenue of research is just too enticing!
109492	Back already? Is there something wrong with our endeavour?
109493	How's the assignment going?
109494	Still on schedule with everything?
109495	What's the current status?
109496	It's great to have you on the project. How far along is it?
109497	So? How's it going? The project, I mean!
109498	Can you give me a status report on the project?
109500	How far along are you on the project?
109501	Seems you found it!
109502	As far as I can see from here, that's it.
109503	That's it, alright.
109504	Great, you found it.
109505	Scanning… Yes, that's it.
109506	This new telemetry is awesome! Yes, that's it.
109507	You work very precisely. I like that. That's the one, by the way.
109508	Right, that's the one!
109509	Location confirmed. Commence transit.
109510	Destination confirmed. Have a good trip.
109511	Yes, that's the location. Please head over there now.
109512	You found the right location, so now all you have to do is go there.
109513	That's the place. If you could just head over there now…
109514	That's the place. Please lock it into your nav and head over there.
109515	That's it. Please head to that location a.s.a.p..
109516	Let me check the satellite image… yes, that's the place.
109517	Awesome work! But we still have another phase to cover...
109518	Great, that's one phase completed. You up for the next one?
109519	Good job. Based on these results, I'd like to offer you a follow-up project.
109520	Look, I know it's gonna be dangerous... but, could you?
109521	Okay, according to the data, this will get pretty ugly. Will you still do it?
109522	Sensors indicate lots of bad guys. They'll probably shoot at you. Still in?
109523	I hate to ask you to head into a combat zone, but I don't really have any other choice.
109525	I have to be honest, it's gonna be pretty dangerous. Will you still do it?
109526	That was one impressive application of military tech!
109528	The post combat analyses are pretty awesome.
109529	Wow. That was almost optimal efficiency.
109530	Are you alright?
109531	It's amazing you managed to survive that.
109532	Wow. You survived that? You must be really tough.
109533	Listen, I'm on to something big. Revolutionary technology and all that. Do you want to help me with the test run?
109534	I'm so excited! This technology could be a real game changer! Do you want to help me field test it?
109535	Ooooh, this new technology is so amazing! Do you want to help me field test it?
109538	Thanks! The results look really promising.
109539	Thank you, that pushed my research light years ahead!
109540	You know, you really grasp new technology fast!
109541	We'll get that to work sooner or later...
109542	Well, back to the drawing board, I guess.
109543	Just a setback! Nothing more.
109544	The Ibarra-FoxCom TechTomorrow program marches on! Suppliers, sell us your technology!
109545	We stand on the verge of a breakthrough and can't allow a shortage of materials!
109546	It's supply and demand, and our demand is pretty high at the moment.
109547	We need a stockpile of materials to bring our new tech to the market.
109548	We wish things were cheaper, too!
109549	Massive supply, everything you need, worldwide! At affordable prices! Give Ibarra-FoxCom your credits!
109550	It was way too expensive.
109551	Our new tech slashed production costs.
109552	Now that production has steadied, we can sell off our surplus.
109553	Whoops! Maybe we should have sold that off more slowly.
109554	If you'd vote for Ibarra-FoxCom, that would help to fund my studies!
109555	People communicate. Distance makes it harder. Ibarra-FoxCom makes it easier.
109556	Ibarra-FoxCom is taking communications to the stars.
109557	At Ibarra-FoxCom, communications is taking on an entirely new dimension.
109558	Communication is one of our most basic instincts and our greatest tool. Ibarra-FoxCom enables.
109559	You don't care much about scientific progress, do you?
109560	Well, it's your choice, I guess.
109561	I'm sure you're doing what you think is best, but you'll see.
109562	You're much too smart to ignore facts this way.
109563	Maybe I didn't explain things clearly.
109564	We appreciate your backing.
109565	Your support means a lot.
109566	With you believing in us, we'll be able to take the next step.
109567	Ibarra-FoxCom really values your support. A lot.
109568	Thanks for keeping the faith. I really appreciate it.
109569	Couldn't decide the last time, huh? No problem, you can still make a difference by supporting us.
109570	I guess your calendar looked like mine. Total chaos! But it's not too late to lend us your support!
109571	Ibarra-FoxCom. We are the market leader in robotics, communications, computing… I'm pretty sure you're using more than one of our products in your facilities.
109572	Ibarra-FoxCom is all about technology. Communications, robotics, computing… we're making the future today.
109573	At Ibarra-FoxCom, we develop technologies designed to help mankind implement their dreams.
109574	Robotics, communications, computing... At Ibarra-FoxCom, the future starts today.
109575	We're here to make life easier through technology. Every day.
109576	Ibarra-FoxCom. Always there with a great idea when you need one.
109577	We are the forerunner when it comes to technology! I think you're smart enough to see that!
109578	It's hard to beat bleeding-edge technology, I know.
115426	I analyzed your performance. Not bad, but nothing beats innovation!
109579	Decent enough performance. But we're just warming up the engines. Soon you'll be eating our dust!
109580	Nice growth! But do you have the technology to sustain it?
109581	Nice job, but you'll be singing a different tune once our new technology hits the market!
109582	Don't get too excited. We're just undergoing a restructuring at the moment.
109583	Overtaking us is one thing, but staying in front is another.
109586	Keep trying. You'll get there someday!
109587	What can I say? I know our edge in technology is hard to beat.
109588	I guess it's probably because our R&D just keeps churning out one great idea after another.
109590	Our communications expertise gives us such an edge, I know.
109591	Don't let it get you down. Our lock on communications, computing and robotics doesn't leave you much to work with…
109592	We all started small. Of course, some of us didn't stay that way…
109593	You have to give people what they want. And what they want are our products.
109595	Sure. Ride this totally irrational trend as long as it runs.
109596	Keep that seat warm for us until we're done restructuring, will you?
115427	The stage is yours. But once our research is done, we'll be the ones in the spotlight!
109597	You know, artificial intelligence is my thing. But it gives you the creeps sometimes. Remember the incident where this AI started dropping nukes a hundred years ago? We could do so much better now, if things weren't so restricted.
109598	Can you believe it? I overheard colleagues saying I wasted money and resources. Thank goodness they're not the ones in charge. Or the ones who secure their phones properly.
109599	Why do I have to justify my budget all the time? Why can't my bosses see that my research will ensure their wealth twenty years from now?
109600	That Volodin guy, does he somehow seem... off to you? We got talking about robotics and AIs and he straight up geeked out. No other way to put it. Then he left in a hurry, guess he was embarassed.
109601	To be honest, Ibarra-FoxCom is like a giant playground for me. I can try out all my ideas under ideal conditions.
109602	Wait, did I water the plants this week? I started programming an automated watering system, but then my mother got upset. Something about plants needing love and robots being soulless autonomatons and bla bla.
109603	The world needs more robots. Big ones, small ones, microscopic ones - the list of potential applications is endless.
109604	I'm so envious of the past sometimes. Sure, a bunch of bad things happened, but they had AIs! Cool ones! Now, thanks to that one freak accident, we're back to the stone age.
109605	Ever had a look at the Lunar Excavation Corp.'s tech? I mean, that stuff is ancient! Don't know how they get anything to work up there... Well, if we make it to the Moon too one day, we'll make them an offer.
109608	When I think of all the great technologies I've gotten to play with I kind of feel like a little kid in a toy store. Hm, no. probably even better than that.
113480	Okay. Hmmm. You were probably detected by either surface radar or orbital surveillance.
113481	You should talk to some of our techs about cloaking.
113482	Scientifically speaking, avoiding detection usually means remaining unseen.
113483	All right, you're in the target area. What series scanners do you have?
113484	Good. Have a look around. Your interface will let you know when you find the right one.
113485	Have a look around. You'll have to rely on optical scanners for this one.
113486	That's the one. Nothing beats good tech!
113487	You found it! With our tech and your skills, it was a no-brainer.
113488	Hey, our scanners helped! Even if you did use the Mark One Human Eyeball to find it…
115341	Status update! We can continue!
115342	Hey there! Can you spare a little time for our project?
115343	There are new insights! Let's continue with our project.
115344	Hey, um... Have you maybe got time to listen to my proposal?
115345	I've discovered something extremly interesting in this sector. Have a look!
115346	Don't be annoyed, okay? Just wanted to offer you a partnership.
114634	Hey, please, don't kick me out... I'm just pursuing a pet project of mine. Give me a minute and you'll see how worthwhile my research is, okay?
114635	Okay, here's the short version... I'm researching ancient AI configurations. You must have heard of the FATHER incident of 2070. Complex AI goes nuts, starts dropping nukes.
114636	Anyway, after that all AI's had identity blockers installed. That's why today's versions are so stable and predictable. Yeah, boring, I know…
114637	But now I've found a submerged structure that seems to run on old AI algorythms. My interest is purely scientific, so if you help me recover it, you may keep any useable materials you find.
114643	Lucky us! It would seem the Ark still has energy reserves. Let me see if they're enough for a system reboot...
114644	Welcome to your Ark. My name is...
114645	So much for that... Seems we have to lift the Ark from its watery grave completely. I'll get back to you.
114646	I'm trying to wheedle a recovery team out of my superiors. Stay tuned.
114696	If we're lucky, the uplift will kickstart the Ark's systems and tickle a few volts out of its battery... Okay, hooks are attached, commence lifting!
114697	Down again. But you realize what we found here? It's an EVE unit! I... I'm going to have to take the time to have a closer look at it.
114700	It will take some time to analyze the Ark's condition. I'll give you a shout.
114698	It's working! Rise and shine, you beautiful piece of ancient tech! Let me start you up!
114699	This is so cool! Functioning EVE software! This could herald a new age of artificial intelligence! Thank you so much!
114695	Can't talk. Totally submerged in EVE's personality code. You can salvage the rest of the Ark.
115072	Oh, hi. Nice to meet you. Dr Eleanor Hofwegen PhD, I don't insist on the "Doctor". I'm in R&D at Ibarra-FoxCom. So if the headlines talk about cool, never-before-seen technology... I'm probably the one who cooked it up.
115884	Whoa, your energy transmitter tech is just amazing. I wish I'd thought of that. Anyway, congratulations.
109613	How splendid.
109614	Most excellent.
109615	Most satisfactory.
109616	That ended well.
109617	I'm certain that will meet with approval.
109618	That will go over well.
109619	Splendid.
109620	All's well that ends well.
109621	That will make some important people happy.
109622	Most splendid.
109623	My superior is satisfied with this development.
109624	Head office will be pleased to see this resolved.
109625	This will go down well at head office.
109626	You have just risen in our esteem.
109627	You have just made a very good impression with the board.
109628	Our CEO has remarked favorably on your performance.
109629	Your work impressed my superior.
109630	You impressed my CEO. You should be proud.
109631	Well done. You seem to know what the board likes.
109632	My CEO admires your grasp of the priorities.
109633	My superior is pleased with your conduct.
109634	You have done an admirable job.
109635	Splendid, you performed well.
109636	How unfortunate.
109637	How unsatisfactory.
109638	Tsk, tsk. Most regrettable.
109639	A most lamentable situation.
109640	A distressing turn of events.
109641	Deplorable, really.
109642	I fear my CEO will not be pleased.
109643	An unsatisfactory solution.
109644	That was not in line with our projections.
109645	A most unfortunate turn.
109646	Your failure will not remain without consequences.
109647	I am afraid your performance was quite unsatisfactory.
109648	My CEO expected more of you, as did I.
109649	Deplorable. You must do better.
109650	The board won't be pleased with your performance.
109651	You do realize there will be repercussions.
109652	Your performance did not conform to our guidelines.
109653	You must realize that this was unacceptable.
109654	You have displeased my superior.
109656	Welcome to Cassian Industries. Can I bring you something?
109657	Cassian Industries welcomes you.
109658	Welcome to the home of Cassian Industries.
109659	Cassian Industries, the world leader in heavy industry. Welcome.
109660	Splendid to see you. What brings you to Cassian today?
109662	A pleasure to see you.
109664	Cassian is pleased to welcome you.
109666	My CEO said yes.
109667	The board has given its approval.
109668	The request has been approved.
109669	Cassian Industries agrees.
109670	My superior approved the request.
109671	You have been greenlit.
109672	Our CEO has given your request the green light.
109673	Your request has been approved.
109674	Cassian has vetted and approved your request.
109675	Your request has been approved at the highest level.
109676	We appologise, we must refuse.
109677	We cannot agree to this request.
109678	The board said no.
109679	I have been informed we must refuse.
109680	My superior has decided that the answer is no.
109681	You must understand that our priorities lie elsewhere.
109682	Unfortunately, Cassian Industries must deny your request.
109683	My CEO has decided your request is not in Cassian's interest.
109684	Regrettably, we simply cannot grant your request.
109685	My superior has instructed me to tell you the answer is no.
109686	We appreciate your attendance. Please consider this proposal for an eventual cooperation.
109687	Cassian Industries would like to offer you an assignment.
109688	My CEO would like to make you an offer that is to our mutual benefit.
109689	On behalf of Cassian, I would ask that you consider the following proposal.
109690	My superior wishes to offer you an assignment.
109691	If you are interested, my superior has an assignment that might be to your taste.
109692	My superior sent me here to contact you. Cassian Industries wishes to call you in to discuss this affair.
109693	I am happy I caught up with you. My CEO would like to offer you an assignment.
109694	It's a pleasure to see you out here. Perhaps you might be interested in an assignment we have.
109695	Ah, here you are. My superior asked me to contact you about an assignment.
109696	How splendid to see you. Would you be interested in an assignment for Cassian Industries?
109697	I have been sent to contact you. My superior wishes to offer you an assignment.
109698	My superior is impressed by what you achieved.
109699	The outcome certainly impressed my CEO, I must say.
109700	Your performance was exactly what Cassian had hoped for.
109702	Your work has received favorable notice at the highest level.
109703	The board was most impressed.
109704	Your completion of the assignment was exemplary.
109705	Cassian Industries values your professionalism.
109706	I'm afraid my superior will have little understanding for such... sloppiness.
109707	My CEO was most disappointed with your performance.
109708	Cassian Industries does not have a long record of tolerating incompetence.
113501	I'm certain my superior will be less than pleased by your refusal.
113502	I believe I know what my CEO will think about this.
113503	Cassian had hoped for more… reliability.
109709	My superior believes the matter was discussed exhaustively. Please move it forward.
109710	Cassian Industries would like you to prioritize completion of this assignment.
109711	Cassian pays well and, in return, expects projects to be given priority.
109712	My superior would like to see the matter resolved quickly.
109713	You have been given all the pertinent information. Please bring your assignment to a successful conclusion.
109714	My CEO is accustomed to faster results. Please expedite the matter.
109715	Cassian Industries believes in in-budget and on time completion. At least you are in budget. So far.
109716	Please conclude your assignment before my superior loses patience.
109717	Allow me to point out the importance of this.
109718	I believe you will find this useful.
109719	You will find this to be important to further progress.
109720	This is integral to your current endeavor.
109721	I have been told to inform you that you will need this.
109722	Finding this was imperative.
109724	Please allow me to reiterate - this is important.
109725	Exactly. This is where you are expected.
109726	Excellent, you have pinpointed your desired location.
109727	Excellent, you have pinpointed the right location.
109728	Splendid, that is the specified location.
109729	Exactly. Please proceed there as quickly as possible.
109730	Cassian Industries is pleased to see that your navigational skills are more than up to par.
109731	Yes, exactly. Now, if you would please proceed there with all haste…
109732	That is the location my superior indicated, yes.
109733	Splendid. However, I'm afraid your contractual obligations also include this task.
109734	Cassian Industries would like to offer you a follow-up assignment.
109735	Based on your to-date performance, my CEO would like to offer you another assignment.
109736	Cassian would like you eliminate this problem. Permanently.
109737	We have an assignment we wish you to complete for us. With extreme prejudice.
109738	My CEO has an assignment for you. Distasteful as it may be, violence is involved.
109739	A situation needing a forcible solution has come up. The board thought of you.
109740	Cassian Industries has a situation suited to your skill. The use of force is required.
109741	A splendid victory. My superior sends her compliments.
109742	Clearly your reputation is warranted. Cassian is grateful.
109743	Cassian Industries congratulates you on an efficient solution to the problem.
109744	Unfortunate. I hope material damage is within reasonable limits.
109745	Our condolences. A loss like that can cut deeply into one's capital.
109746	Cassian Industries had hoped for a more… satisfactory conclusion.
109747	Cassian is a house of snakes. That is all I can say. You are the only one left I can trust with this delicate matter.
109748	Cassian Industries requires that this assignment be handled with the utmost discretion.
109749	My superior has an assignment for you. I have assured her that you are most discreet.
109750	You were the right person to trust. And now let us forget this ever happened.
109751	Your discretion is exemplary. Cassian is grateful.
109752	An assignment completed as discreetly as one could wish. My superior is impressed.
109753	What a catastrophe! I deleted all our correspondence on this subject. And you should do the same.
109754	Fortunately, I have a contingency. How disappointing.
109755	It seems it was auspicious of me to destroy all evidence of any connection between us.
109756	Our only concern is the stability of the global market. And it is much more stable with such goods in our possession!
109757	You must understand that Cassian Industries cannot leave the market subject to chance.
109758	Please do not misinterpret this measure. It is simply supply and demand, nothing more.
109759	We all know that such things are commonplace in a free market economy.
109760	Please rest assured that no one is receiving these goods at a lower price than you are.
109761	The board is well aware of the fact that sometimes you have to be more than generous to reach a higher goal in the long run.
109762	Cassian Industries is merely responding to a need to limit inflation.
109763	My superior is firmly committed to providing goods to the public at a price fair to all.
109764	The world has made Cassian Industries number one, and we are simply showing our gratitude.
109765	The price was being kept high artificially, which is unconscionable.
109766	Coal. Steel. Stone. The fundaments of a better tomorrow! Support us, and your future will rest on solid ground!
109767	Cassian Industries. Building a solid base today from which we can soar into the future - together.
109768	Cassian Industries is building on the past to provide a better future, and you can be part of it!
109769	The traditions of our past hold the key to a shining future. Join us in celebrating both as we take the world into tomorrow.
109770	The bigger the dream, the more solid its base must be. Cassian Industries - building today for a bright tomorrow.
109771	You should reconsider your sympathies. Or you might find that you have one day... overreached yourself.
109772	The future is what we make of it. Cassian Industries is the future. Join us! It is not too late!
109773	The time has never been better to join the wave of tomorrow. We are that wave.
109774	My superior once again invites you to join us in a future bright with promise!
109775	Sad as it is, every race can have but one winner. It is not too late for you to lend us your support.
109776	My superior wishes you to know that she is grateful for your support.
109777	Cassian Industries would like to thank you for your generous help and support.
109778	Cooperation is the key to success, and we at Cassian appreciate your efforts.
109779	My CEO has asked me to express her appreciation of your support.
109781	My superior presumed that you were not interested in corporate politics. Prove her wrong and give us your support.
109782	My abject apologies for forgetting to remind you to vote earlier. However, there is still time…
109783	Cassian Industries. Strong. Reliable. Solid. Just like the natural resources we mine and process all around the world.
109784	Cassian Industries builds the foundations of mankind's dreams.
109785	At Cassian Industries, we value the Earth's plenteous bounty and strive to use it for the good of all mankind.
109786	Cassian Industries' mission is refining nature's own building blocks to better serve mankind.
109787	Cassian Industries refines ore to build dreams.
109788	Cassian Industries provides mankind a solid footing from which to embrace the future.
109789	Millions of customers cannot lie! Cassian Industries is now at the forefront of international business!
109790	Cassian Industries is the world's business leader!
109791	Do not worry, mid-size businesses are just as important as the market leaders. Or are they?
109792	Cassian Industries did not advance to where they are today through short-term, high-visibility escapades.
109793	One must be careful not to exhaust oneself with sprinting if one wishes to win the race.
109794	Improvement is to be striven for and admired - but not overrated.
109795	Growth is a fine thing, if it can be sustained. If.
109796	Cassian Industries also started small, although that was many years ago.
109797	In the world of business there is no way around Cassian Industries. Especially not for you.
109798	Never cease trying. Cassian Industries will always be there to inspire you.
109799	It is in our nature to strive for dominion. Cassian Industries simply happens to be better at it.
109800	Never despair. We all learned to walk before we could run. Some faster, some… well…
109801	Commendable of you to try to emulate Cassian Industries' success. Audacious, but commendable.
109802	It is the nature of the beast. Small dogs learn from big dogs.
109803	Everyone starts small. Some thrive and grow while some… need a little longer.
109804	Someday you, too, may manage to join The Big Five. Someday.
109805	Pursuing your dream is never easy. It was for us but, then again, we are Cassian Industries.
109806	You do know that trying to emulate Cassian Industries is shooting for the stars.
109807	You should keep a close eye on the market analyses! They will soon show you on your way back to where you belong!
109808	You might want to take time to consolidate. You would not be the first to overstretch in haste.
109809	Be assured I would appreciate an offer to work for you, but I would have to decline it. You see, at Cassian Industries we are all one big family. And I have a very strict mother, so to say.
109810	Cassian Industries has given me the chance to hone and develop my skills in a challenging environment.
109811	If you ask me, Buhari is rather a smug bastard. He landed his job by sucking up to the boss and now he sneers at - pardon me. Please forget I said anything. I certainly didn't mean to.
109812	My superior is a very demanding employer. Yet I find the challenge… invigorating.
109813	Cassian Industries has become my home and my family.
109814	Cassian Industries strives to be the best. The higher one climbs within the company, the more one must strive.
109815	I've developed an interest in snowshoeing. Of course, there aren't many places to do so and I can barely find the time for it, but it's always worth it. The peace and quiet, the endless white, spending quality time... Oh sorry, I was lost in thought,
109816	My superior just came back from signing a deal to ensure our newly upgraded machines are running at full power. May Tian proved to be a tough negotiator, I didn't expect my superior to settle for a compromise! Not a word to her, of course.
109817	The Arctic Custodians clutch to metal deposits like an polar bear cub to a melting floe. This eco-despotism makes them blind to see how urgently we... that is humanity... needs access to these unclaimed treasures.
109818	I've been meaning to submit my vacation schedule all week... But I'm unsure as to whether I shouldn't rather wait and sync it with my superior's. Then again, I can't stall any longer. What to do?
109819	I was most surprised when Volodin approached us about collaborating. Not that it wasn't on my superior's mind. I can't put my finger on it, but something about him unsettles me... Excuse me, I should not be speaking of my colleagues in this manner.
109820	Corporate life is so stimulating. The thrill of the hunt for new ventures, tracking, tracing and planning before moving in for the kill. Incomparable!
109821	I once thought this would be but another stepping stone on my journey. How naive of me…
109822	Why can't people see that we don't take resources away from the Earth, we simply reshape them? There's no harm in that.
109823	It's saddening the way some babble on about a lack of natural resources and then want to lock those we do have away.
109824	To be perfectly honest, I consider anyone who lives in modern housing while complaining about our activities a hypocrite.
113504	Hmmm, sometimes a low profile is of more use, don't you think?
113505	Don't worry. I'll try to sugarcoat your being detected to the board… somehow.
113506	Cassian expects the utmost discretion from its partners!
113507	Our information points to that being the right area. Please begin your search.
113508	According to our sources, the object should be somewhere in your vicinity.
113509	My superior wishes you to begin your search in that area.
113510	That is the right one. I am certain my superior will be pleased with your performance in this mission.
113511	Cassian congratulates you on your success in finding the object in question.
113512	My CEO is impressed by the skill you showed in finding the object.
115073	My superior sends her regards. If you wish to contact the board of Cassian Industries or have any querstions about our heavy industry projects, please contact me. My name is Aidan Bhargava.
115365	May I ask you to return to the site of our joint venture.
115366	I'm here to inform you that our project needs your attention.
115367	There are new developments in regards to our shared project.
115368	Cassian Industries is very eager to found a joint venture with you here.
115369	If you consider a joint venture in this sector, I will be your contact person.
115370	My superior awaits your decision. Will you join us in a joint project?
115538	A pleasure to see you. I have a proposal for you from Cassian Industries: How do you feel about making use of the stuff stars are made of?
115539	The Moon is riddled with meteor craters. Of course it's a nightmare for the people living there, but why not make the best of it for us?
115540	The minerals we can extract may just prove to be the next essential resource, not to mention the scientific discoveries, of which even Ibarra-Foxcom is certain to be jealous.
115541	Cassian Industries wants to offer you this unique opportunity for collaboration. We'll be the first to discover that which humanity will long for in the ages to come.
115542	This mine truly turned out to be as glorious as the famous diamond mines of Golkonda. My CEO requests my presence immediately, I'll be in touch.
115543	The project is certainly proving worthwhile, is it not? But I'm afraid I'm rather preoccupied at the moment. I'll contact you at my earliest convenience.
115544	I appreciate your cooperation. However, the project has been deemed too risky and will be terminated. Yet perhaps... I do believe there is a way. I'll report back to you.
115545	My superior has yet to reply to my inquiries. Please do be patient.
115546	Splendid! This is the greatest deposit yet! My superior has personally resurrected the project. I confess, I didn't think it possible. You have my gratitude.
115547	For a time, I feared my superior was correct in considering the project utopian. Instead, I have now been given more tasks of a similar nature.
115885	My superior sends her congratulations on your acquisitions.
110031	Yes, impressive. Very much so.
110032	Excellent, simply excellent.
110033	That's much better.
110034	A relief.
110035	Good to see.
110036	A definite improvement.
110037	So that's that, then.
110038	Done, and well done.
110039	That turned out well.
110040	All's well that ends well.
115359	All of the hindrances are out of the way. Shall we proceed?
115360	The time has come. We should begin our next moves.
115361	There are new opportunities awaiting us. Shall we?
115362	Why don't we get together and talk? I have something for you.
115363	I don't want anyone else for my next project. So if you have time...
115364	Please, come to me. I have an offer to make.
114917	You see, the Arctic is the only place on Earth where fossil fuels can still be found. Many corporations have tried to mercilessly exploit this source of wealth in the past... and failed.
114926	The Arctic Custodians are quick to show any companies the door if they raise even the slightest suspicion of polluting the environment.
114927	Yet, these rusty carcasses remained here, many of them shedding black blood from old wounds. But we at Usoyev Incorporated have offered to render them harmless for the Arctic Custodians. With your support, I hope.
115257	The Oil Barrels? Well, there is a lot of residue when you dismantle an oil rig. Keep them for now. I might even have more for you to... dispose of. But that has to remain between us. We should not meet for a while.
115258	Keep a low profile until the furore about the transporter incident has died down. I'll contact you.
115259	I knew you could do it! Of course, we were still forced to recover the oil from this rig for safety's sake. Please, keep those barrels under tight wraps. We should part ways for now.
115260	Just be patient. We will persist with our project. Opportunity will present itself.
115261	And they say environmentalism isn't a paying proposition. Don't forget to come and get your share of the... hazardous goods to dispose of every now and then. You've shown you're worth it.
116320	I had hoped to meet you here. I know you are unlike other CEOs. You don't shy away from uncomfortable decisions where our environment is concerned. That's why I want to offer you this opportunity.
116322	To freely quote a long-dead fellow countryman: You need oil. There is oil. It's that easy.
110041	Finally, we can have peace of mind.
110042	It's a relief to have that out of the way.
110043	I think we're all happier now that that's been taken care of.
110044	You are very talented leader. I knew that right away.
110045	You did an excellent job on that.
110046	You certainly did well, I have to tell you.
110047	That's much better. You did well!
110048	You have a talent for coming up with innovative solutions.
110049	A very impressive job you did there.
110050	You see? I told you that you were more than capable.
110051	You have the potential to go far, my friend.
110052	You know, I think you will go far.
110053	Excellent job, my friend.
110054	What could we have done.
110055	Ah, well. That could have gone better.
110056	Strange. Everything seemed to be going well, and then…
110057	When all is said and done, that was disappointing.
110058	That could have turned out better, I think.
110059	If we learn from it, then it wasn't a total loss.
110060	Some things work, some don't. Review, learn and move on.
110061	Things will go better next time.
110062	Never give up. There is always tomorrow.
110063	My friend, you know the saying if life gives us lemons we make lemonade.
110064	We both know you can do better than that.
110066	We all make mistakes, my friend. As long as we learn from them…
110067	Don't give up. We both know you can do better than that.
110065	You win some, you lose some.
110068	You didn't come even close to your potential this time.
110069	My friend, we all make mistakes. The only shame lies in making the same one twice.
110070	You could have done much better. Still, there's always next time.
110071	You have to improve your game if you want to succeed.
110072	I watched you, you know. You usually do better than that.
110073	You can do better, you must do better and you will do better, my friend.
110074	Well, well, what a surprise.
110075	So very good to see you again.
110076	It's good to see you!
110077	So, you didn't forget your old friend after all!
110078	It's nice of you to drop by.
110079	Ah, it's good to see a friendly face. Come on in.
110080	Good to see you again, my friend.
110081	Come in, Come in.
110082	Come on in, the door is open.
110083	Hello, my friend. It's always good to see you.
110084	A reasonable request. So, yes.
110085	I think that can be arranged.
110086	Certainly, why not?
110087	Yes, yes, no problem.
110088	Sure, I can do that.
110089	Don't worry, you have my support.
110090	When you put that way, then yes, of course.
110091	You only had to ask, my friend.
110092	Happy to be able to help you with this.
110093	Always happy to help you, my friend.
110094	Sorry, I can't help you.
110095	I'm afraid the answer is no.
110096	Some things I cannot do.
110097	I'm sorry, but the answer is no.
110098	No. I'm sorry, but no.
110099	I can't help you.
110100	I'm afraid I can't help you.
110101	I'm sorry, but I have to tell you no.
110102	I'm going to have to say no to you this time, my friend.
110103	I hate to tell you this, but I have to say no.
110104	Ah, yes. I was just thinking about who could I ask to help me with this task.
110105	Ah, Excellent timing, my friend.
110106	You always know just when to come by! This job is right up your alley.
110107	Come in, come in. It's good to see you again. Interested in doing a job for me?
110108	Ah, perfect timing. My friend, I have a job and I need someone I can trust.
110109	Welcome! How have you been? Look, my friend, I have a job and could use your help.
110110	I didn't think I would have to travel so far, but I wanted to offer you this opportunity.
110111	I like to get out of the office when I can. It's good to see you. Interested in a little job?
110112	Ah, there you are! You move around a lot, don't you? No matter. I have a job for you, my friend.
110113	There is no such thing as coincidence. My friend, I have a job I could use your help with.
110114	What brings you out here? This is too good to be true. My friend, I have a job which you might like.
110115	Ha! Fortune smiles upon me again! Just the person I wanted to see. I have a little job, you see…
110116	Follow that course and you have a bright future ahead of you.
110117	You have done very well indeed, my friend.
110118	An excellent job, my friend. I am proud of you.
110119	If you keep this up, you will one day go far.
110120	Well, you can add that one to your list of jobs well done.
110121	Well done! You are doing even better than I had hoped!
110122	Your decisions are good and your performance is even better. Well done.
110123	Good job, my friend.
110124	I am sure you will learn from your mistakes.
110125	We all make mistakes. If we learn from them, they are even valuable.
110126	I won't lie to you. That could have, should have gone better. But it happens to all of us sometimes.
110127	Please, feel at home. But I'm sure you have more pressing matters to attend to right now.
110128	Good to see you again! And how is your task progressing? Well, I hope.
110129	My friend, the key to success is finishing one task before moving on to the next. How far along are you?
110130	You know you are always welcome here, but that task is relatively urgent.
110131	If I'm not imposing, my friend, I would like you to finish that job as soon as possible.
110132	I know you have much on your mind, so please don't get me wrong when I remind you about that task I gave you.
110133	That task must be finished, my friend. Delaying it won't make it go away.
110134	My friend, every task we take is an opportunity to hone our skills. So, are you done yet?
110135	Nothing escapes your glance.
110136	Exactly. Well spotted.
110137	You found that quickly, my friend.
110138	Ah ha! You found it!
110139	That is the one we need, yes.
110140	Good, you found it. You know what to do next, my friend.
110141	Yes, that's the one, alright.
110142	Excellent job! You found it.
110143	Circumstances will eventually take you to this spot.
110144	Exactly. That is the spot I was talking about.
110145	You see? I told you that you would find it!
110146	You follow directions well, my friend.
110147	You found the right spot very quickly! Very good.
110148	Yes, that is your destination, my friend.
110149	That is where you need to go, yes.
110150	Now you know where you need to go.
110151	I knew our collaboration would be fruitful, so I already prepared another assignment for you.
110152	That was excellent, my friend. Are you ready to take the next step?
110153	You did so well on that task, my friend, I would like you to take on the next one, too.
110154	It is a risk, certainly. But who could handle such dangers, if not you?
110155	My friend, it will be dangerous. But I know you are up to this task!
110156	I don't like to ask, my friend. But you are the only one I know who could do it and live.
110157	We both know it will be dangerous, but you are one of the few warriors left, my friend.
110158	I know you can brave the dangers out there, otherwise I would never have asked you.
110159	Often a strong hand is required to wring order from chaos. Yours was certainly strong enough.
110160	I still wish I hadn't had to ask you, my friend, but you did even better than I dared hope.
110161	I knew you were a warrior, my friend, but that was exceptional.
110162	Highly regrettable. We would have intervened, but... no use.
110163	My friend, I am so sorry! If I had known the enemy's strength, I wouldn't have sent you in!
110164	It's good to see you made it out alive. That which doesn't kill us, makes us stronger!
110165	This request might be a little... unorthodox, perhaps. But I trust you.
110166	No need to be modest. You have rendered me... us a great service.
110167	I would have expected more enthusiasm, considering the trust I put in you.
110168	From time to time these things are necessary.
110169	Production has slowed. If we do not increase the price, there will soon be none left on the market!
110170	It is the nature of business. When you take a loss, you must take a profit to compensate,
110171	Not every deal pans out. Sometimes you must recoup your losses – or starve.
110172	The law of supply and demand, my friend. It is merciless.
110173	When the price of something is too inflated, it can threaten the entire market.
110174	What can I say? We bought too much and need to cut our losses.
110175	My friend, you've got to know when to hold them, and know when to fold them.
110176	We both know how tight money is these days. In this case, cutting our loss is almost a public service.
110177	This will cause competitors to become incautious and overextend themselves, my friend.
110178	The magic of weightlessness promises to redefine chemistry, and Usoyev will be there!
110179	Usoyev Inc. is going to take chemistry to the stars.
110180	No one is better suited to perform the chemical analyses and production space travel requires.
110181	Usoyev Inc. lives and breathes for chemistry. A sacred trust we will uphold until the stars themselves grow cold.
110182	At Usoyev, we strive to make chemistry cleaner, more efficient and more versatile – every day.
110183	Don't forget, friends look out for one another.
110184	Was it something I said?
110185	Your support would mean a great deal, my friend.
110186	You could do much worse than to support us.
110187	Remember, Usoyev never forgets a friend.
110188	Thank you, my friend. I knew I could rely on you.
110189	Usoyev values your support – almost as much as I do.
110190	Your support means more than you think. Many look up to you, and will follow your lead.
110191	I will not forget this, my friend. Know that I will always have your back.
110192	It does my heart good to see that you value friendship as much as I do.
110193	My friend, when an intelligent person forgets to vote, the idiots get to decide.
110194	You must have been very busy, if you forgot to vote.
110195	Chemistry. Foundation of all things material. Of all things human. Usoyev Inc. has a long tradition of working with the very building blocks of existence... For the good of all.
110196	Usoyev Inc. is chemistry, and chemistry is Usoyev.
110197	Usoyev is the world leader in chemistry and chemical products. A responsibility we take seriously.
110198	Every day, Usoyev takes modern chemistry to new, dizzying heights, opening new doors for mankind.
110199	Chemistry is a vast field, not without danger. Only a firm like Usoyev has the experience needed to minimize those dangers.
110200	Usoyev Inc. is the world leader in chemistry because we work safer, cleaner and smarter.
110201	Don't be glum, my friend. Usoyev has been in business much longer than you.
110202	My friend, when someone passes you, watch them and learn – and then use what you have learned.
110203	I think perhaps Usoyev has spent too much time and energy supporting you.
110204	I'm afraid the time has come where I must spend more time on company business.
110205	Do not misuse the help you have been given.
110206	Usoyev is based on solid, long-term growth. Chemistry is a business where you evaluate risks carefully.
110207	Slowly, my friend, slowly. A tall, thin sapling may break when it grows too fast.
110208	You are doing well, but you should take time to consolidate your growth, like we do.
110209	You are doing very well indeed. One day you may even turn the Big Five into the Big Six!
110210	Don't despair. You are actually doing extremely well for one so new to business!
110211	Relax, my friend. Usoyev has been in business a long time. Trying to catch us is... ambitious.
110212	You know, I really enjoy helping you. You remind me of myself when I was younger.
110213	Never stop trying. You may never be another Usoyev, but you can still be a success.
110214	Work, learn and grow. I will always be here to advise you.
110215	I know it is frustrating, but you can't expect to compete with Usoyev so soon.
110216	One day you too will reach these heights. Don't be afraid to ask if you need advice.
110217	Usoyev was also small once. Of course, that was long, long ago.
110218	Ambition you have. Now, if you just have the stamina, one day you too will climb to the top.
110219	Congratulations. Now, if you will excuse me, it's time I got back to my own business.
110220	Well done. Now consolidate, before the surge you rode subsides.
110221	Everybody has their own opinion about the uses and dangers of modern chemistry – but everyone buys our products.
110222	In the beginning, there was chemistry.
110223	Usoyev products are used to make medicine, sterilize food containers, make household items and so much more.
110224	Chemistry is my lifeblood. Not literally, of course. But I don't know what my life would be without it.
110225	You know, my friend, for all our advances, I believe we are but at the beginning of what chemistry has to offer.
110226	There is a theory that life on Earth arose from chemical components contained in meteoric ice. Fascinating!
110227	Dr. Hofwegen is quite the energetic young woman. A tad too energetic maybe. It's disconcerting.
110228	When I visited Dr. Young, I was also introduced to his dog. Is it customary to treat a dog like a fellow person? It seems strange to me, but Dr. Young treats him with great love and care, I can tell.
110229	The Moon colonies have been around a while, but with the Second Wave I've become very interested on life on the Moon. Being confined to a shelter or a suit, always checking your oxygen supply... it all seems so restrictive, don't you think?
110230	Buhari keeps warning about overfertilization and aggressive chemicals in our food supply. But I don't fault him, it's natural to be suspicious. In truth, none of his crops would grow without our help.
110231	From the primordial ooze to champagne, rocket fuel and life itself – it is all chemistry.
110232	My first chemistry teacher showed us the cola and peppermint trick – and I was hooked. I love chemistry!
110233	I believe we would be better off if everyone at least knew what chemistry is. Sadly, for most – it's just a word.
110234	Name me two things you use every day that aren't chemicals or chemical products. Go ahead. Try!
110235	I hope that I will one day find someone whose passion for chemistry equals my own. Then I will be free to retire.
110236	I really enjoy rock climbing. Or I did once. My colleagues worry a great deal about my health. Now I'm trying safer sports to keep in shape. Testing your own body's limits is not something I want to give up.
115075	A pleasure to meet you. Luca Volodin, consultant at Usoyev Incorporated. I already heard about you. The new fish in the pond with the five big sharks. If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to ask this old swimmer.
115886	I expected nothing less of you. Enjoy your success. People should do that.
109825	Acceptable.
109826	Adequate.
109827	Noted.
109828	File closed.
109829	Satisfactory.
109830	That's that settled.
109831	So the situation has been resolved.
109832	Time to close that file, then.
109833	Satisfactory.
109834	Passable.
109835	So, I can consider the problem solved. Good.
109836	That was an unpredictable variable. I'm glad it's gone.
109837	One less thing to deal with.
109838	We expected as much of you.
109839	You did well.
109840	You work quickly and efficiently. Good.
109841	It seems you are a problem solver.
109842	We knew you would take care of it.
109843	You did an excellent job.
109844	Your skills are admirable.
109845	You dealt with that situation well.
109846	You did what you set out to do. Commendable.
109847	That turned out well, don't you think?
109848	That was waiting to happen.
109849	No surprise.
109850	I am underwhelmed.
109851	An unsatisfactory situation.
109852	A failure.
109853	Not what we wanted.
109854	That should not have happened.
109855	Unnecessary.
109856	Should not have happenend.
109857	An undesirable outcome.
109858	Do you see me applauding?
109859	You failed to remedy the situation.
109860	You will never succeed if you don't concentrate on the task at hand.
109861	You were supposed to solve the problem.
109862	You could have done much better.
109863	I hope that was not indicative of your skill.
109864	Do I look happy to you?
109865	You did not meet my expectations.
109866	I expected more of you.
109867	Your performance failed to impress me.
109868	Keep it short. Our rivals never rest.
109869	Yes? What is it?
109870	Make it quick. I'm a busy person.
109871	What did you want to see me about?
109872	I can give you three minutes.
109873	What is on your mind?
109874	The short version, please.
109875	Very well. You have five minutes.
109876	My time is valuable. What is it?
109877	Well? Spit it out.
109878	There is no other option.
109879	Affirmative.
109880	Confirmed.
109881	Request approved.
109882	Very well.
109883	I can give you the go ahead on that.
109884	Your request has been approved.
109885	We have agreed to your request.
109886	You have our assent.
109887	Consider your request approved.
109888	No.
109889	Impossible.
109890	Forget it.
109891	Out of the question.
109892	Unacceptable. No.
109893	You think this is our concern?
109894	What do you think this has to do with us?
109895	You knew the answer would be no.
109896	You're wasting my time and yours. No.
109897	You know my answer. No.
109898	Yes, yes, hello and such. Now tell me, will you take on this assignment?
109899	Welcome. I have an assignment for you, if you're interested.
109900	Good, you're here. I have a job for you.
109901	Yes, this is my home. Doesn't matter. This is about work.
109902	Home office today. I have a job for you.
109903	Come on in. So, interested in an assignment?
109904	I won't stay long. Just need your decision on a possible joint project.
109905	So this is where you got to. Interested in an assignment?
109906	Glad I found you. I have a project for you.
109907	Good, I found you. Listen, I have an assignment for you.
109908	Glad I ran into you. Interested in a new project?
109909	I'm just on my way back, but I wanted to offer you a project.
109910	I see. The results-oriented type.
109911	You do good work.
109912	I see you realize time is money.
109913	You don't waste any time. I like that.
109914	It seems you value efficiency. So do I.
109915	You did a very capable job.
109916	Your project was a success. Excellent.
109917	I see you have as little patience with fools as I have.
109918	Failure was not part of our contract.
109919	If I had wanted you to fail, I would have said so.
109920	That was not what you were hired to do.
109921	I know, I'm easy to look at. But fulfilling one's commitments is equally attractive.
109922	The attention is flattering, but I'd prefer a status report.
109923	Why are you here? How is your project coming along?
109924	Good. I was going to call you for a status report.
109925	Have you finished your assignment yet?
109926	How is that project going? Almost done?
109927	So, is your project done yet?
109928	So, have you finished that project?
109929	That's it.
109930	Yes, that's the one.
109931	From what I can see, that's it.
109932	So you found it.
109933	Good, you managed to locate it.
109934	Exactly. That's the one.
109935	That is the one specified, yes.
109936	According to my information, that should be it.
109937	Yes, there.
109938	That is the correct location.
109939	That is your destination.
109940	Yes, that is the place I meant.
109941	That is the target location, yes.
109942	That is where you need to go.
109943	Now you've found it, off you go.
109944	Yes, that's the spot indicated.
109945	Good execution. I hope you will take the subsequent operation just as seriously.
109946	Well done. Now on to the next step.
109947	That's the first part done. Time to follow it up.
109948	A question of security. Your collaboration would be appreciated.
109949	We have a security incident that requires your attention, if you are willing.
109950	We have a problem requiring armed intervention. Interested?
109951	This project is dangerous. Use of force may be required.
109952	This job is dangerous. Go in armed and ready.
109953	A quick, relentless, final solution. Exactly what we asked for.
109954	That problem won't be cropping up again. Well done.
109955	Brutally efficient. Perfect.
109956	If this is your idea of the art of war, I'd prefer to stick with the original.
109957	That was a waste of resources.
109958	That was not what I hired you for.
109959	Why not combine resources? Information like this would benefit both of us.
109960	Always stay one step ahead of the competition. It seems we agree on that.
109961	I thought I made it clear that this mission is all about intelligence? In both senses of the word.
109962	We do not have to explain our actions to anyone.
109963	It was necessary.
109964	We couldn't allow one of our competitors to put the squeeze on us.
109965	Rumor has it one of our competitors wants to bottleneck us on some vital goods.
109966	Just buying to accommodate projected needs.
109967	We do not want anyone to think we are hoarding.
109968	These goods are now surplus.
109969	We no longer need them and they are taking up storage space.
109970	We need more storage capacity.
109971	Other goods now have a higher priority.
109972	Lei Sheng Electricity is the global energy leader. Solar energy is one of our mainstays, the sun never sets in space.
109973	Lei Sheng stands poised on the threshold to space.
109974	Space poses its own energy problems, and who is better suited to mastering them than Lei Sheng?
109975	Lei Sheng Electricity is dedicated to offering mankind integrated energy solutions wherever it may go.
109976	Lei Sheng Electricity will power the stars.
109977	I am disappointed by your lack of insight.
109978	I find your lack of faith… disturbing.
109979	I do not understand you. You seem intelligent enough…
109980	Obviously you do not comprehend the Lei Sheng vision.
109981	I do not know why you fail to support Lei Sheng, but I will soon.
109982	With your support, Lei Sheng will power mankind's voyage to the stars.
109983	You should know I appreciate what you do for us.
109984	Lei Sheng places great value on reliable partners such as yourself.
109985	Lei Sheng greatly appreciates your support.
109986	Your support means a great deal to Lei Sheng Electricity.
109988	I'm certain you simply forgot to vote. There is still time to choose wisely.
109989	Lei Sheng Electricity is the world leader in energy production.
109990	At Lei Sheng, we harvest a wide variety of energy sources to ensure mankind has the energy it needs.
109991	We have been going through some restructuring, which has led some to think we are losing ground. Nonsense.
109992	Lei Sheng Electricity rose to become world leader by knowing what our customers want.
109993	Knowing what customers want is the key to success. It's all about information.
109994	Lei Sheng Electricity knows the energy market better than anyone. That is why we are the world leader.
109995	Trying to keep pace with us is futile. Lei Sheng Electricity moves at the speed of light.
109996	Lei Sheng Electricity is again on the rise.
109997	Congratulations on your success. May you one day be as powerful as Lei Sheng.
109998	You would be better advised to build your firm from a solid base instead of flitting about.
109999	It seems your firm is doing well. Enjoy it while it lasts.
110000	Do you really believe that working as a service provider will offer you the long-term security a large firm needs?
110001	Savor success while it lasts.
110002	Isn't success satisfying? We at Lei Sheng have savored it many times.
110003	At Lei Sheng Electricity, we are all about focus. You could learn from that.
110004	No need to be embarrassed. After all, Lei Sheng is a market leader.
110005	Work hard, pay attention to your customers and one day you will enjoy the success Lei Sheng enjoys.
110006	Trying to compete with a firm such as Lei Sheng is almost impossible, I know.
110007	The difference between winners and losers is that winners never stop trying.
110008	Your firm reminds me of Lei Sheng Electricity back in the beginning.
110009	No one knows their customers like Lei Sheng Electricity. Another reason we are so successful.
110010	If you wish to be as successful as Lei Sheng, then you must work, work, work.
110011	Don't worry. The road to the top is a path of many steps taken one at a time.
110012	Lei Sheng wasn't built in a day, either.
110013	Once Lei Sheng is finished restructuring, everything will return to the natural order.
110014	Congratulations on your first taste of success.
110015	People always think I'm a cold fish. Apparently that's the treatment accorded those who separate their business and professional lives.
110016	Our current system is efficient. The Big Five provide the core services while smaller firms fill in the gaps.
110017	Energy is a key element in our society, yet it is still always taken for granted. That can be useful. I wonder if they would keep harping on at us if they knew how much depended on our company and its work. Under no circumstances can we delay our moon program.
110018	I appreciate people who get to the point, and quickly. Business isn't about mincing words, no matter how much Bharghava likes the sound of his own.
110019	Don't think I can't see the vultures circling my company. The rest of the Big Five really believe we are just keeping up appearances. Times are tough, but this dry spell won't last forever and I intend to end it.
110020	Our clients would be surprised how much you can tell by their electricity bill. We have to stay informed as to exactly which machines are straining our grid, after all. To calculate our input, of course.
110021	If this keeps up, I'll have to cancel my tickets for the premiere, and I'm not letting that happen.
110022	We have barely learned to run here on Earth and now we stumble into space.
110023	It puzzles me that no one seems to realize that mastering a niche market is just as vital and challenging as being a global player.
110024	I am always amazed by how many firms believe they can make it to the top without the proper intelligence.
110025	Our world is full of small fish who all believe they are sharks. Sad, but amusing.
110026	I love my job. Gathering intelligence and sorting it, arranging it, has a wonderful geometric beauty, like crystal lattices of pure information.
110027	People often compare me to the captain in those vintage scifi movies. My job has fewer aliens and more calculations, though.
110028	Proper work-life balance is such a trite phrase, no one else takes it seriously. But if I were to take all that stress with me when I go home... no thanks.
110029	Capitalism is competition. Alliances are formed for the hunt but, in the end, everyone wants the biggest piece of the prey.
110030	Most people tend to act without sufficient forethought. I will never understand that.
115347	Your presence is required at our project site.
115348	Now, shall we continue?
115349	Reporting on the project. There is much for you to do.
115350	Just one minute. I have something to propose to you.
115351	Don't let my reserved manner discourage you. I do wish to cooperate.
115352	I've been informed that you are currently in this sector. Please meet me.
114547	Yes, technically this is an unannounced intrusion into your territory. But before you report me, listen to my offer.
114548	A short while ago this was only ruins, but that's water over the dam now. Water that provides energy.
114549	Once, Lei Sheng pursued the construction of a hydroelectric power station here.
114550	The stations were based on designs taken over from the bankrupt corporation Global Trust. But the project was aborted, after the dams... became inoperable.
114551	But if you join forces with Lei Sheng we could rebuild the dams. And half of the energy produced would be yours. Do I have your attention?
114552	Good. The first dam is fully functional. But we won't be satisfied with one, am I correct? I will contact you once everything is ready.
114553	Impressive! Only one dam left. Let me take care of the necessary paperwork. You'll hear from me once we can continue.
114554	All is running smoothly. I'm not easily impressed, but I certainly should keep an eye on you!
114531	You know, before you were assigned Fairwater Coast, Lei Sheng pursued a construction project for hydroelectric power stations here.
114532	The stations were based on designs Lei Sheng took over from its bankrupt rival Global Trust. But the project was dismissed after... incidents made the dams inoperable.
114533	If we would join forces, we could bring the dam building to a conclusion. And half of the produced energy would be entitled to your corporation. Do I have your attention now?
114534	There it is. Our first dam, standing tall and operating smoothly. But we won't settle for one, right?
114544	The second dam is completed. I must say, you are driving our project forward.
114535	Look at this facility! I'm not known to praise people. But one thing I learned during our shared project: I have to keep an eye on you!
114530	Dammed water is a source of energy.
115074	May Tian. Head of Intelligence for Lei Sheng. Just don't hit me with any of that "Lei Sheng is a dying energy firm" nonsense and we'll get along just fine.
115887	I'm not good at this. Look, I'm impressed. Is that enough?
110237	Noteworthy.
110238	A satisfactory solution.
110239	Good enough, I suppose.
110240	That will do fine.
110241	Good enough for me.
110242	It works, and that's all that matters.
110243	So the situation has been resolved. Good.
110244	That's done, then. So, on to the next item on the agenda.
110245	One less distraction. Good.
110246	That's one problem fewer. Lovely.
110247	That can only be beneficial for us.
110248	So that won't be causing us any problems, then.
110249	Good. Now I won't have to waste any more time on that.
110250	You have not disappointed us.
110251	Very efficient job you did there.
110252	You took care of that quickly. I like that.
110253	That was fast. Finally, someone who understands that time is money.
110254	Excellent work. You seem to know what business is all about.
110255	You did well. Problems are simply a waste of money and resources.
110256	That is how you do business. Well done.
110257	You work with admirable efficiency.
110258	See the problem, solve the problem. You are a good business partner.
110259	You found a solution with a minimum investment of time. Well done.
110260	Unfortunate. But also unavoidable.
110261	These things happen. Unfortunately.
110262	That did not turn out the way we wanted.
110263	I think we all wanted a better outcome, but we don't always get what we want.
110264	That will have a negative impact on the market.
110265	It is what it is.
110266	Not the worst case scenario, but not good.
110267	I think we all know that could have gone much better.
110268	A very poor showing.
110269	What can I say? That was bad.
110270	You see me irritated.
110271	I am not amused.
110272	Are you out to deliberately destabilize the market?
110273	Your actions are affecting the market. I suggest you do better next time.
110274	Your actions make no financial sense whatsoever.
110275	You might want to rethink your modus operandi.
110276	Either you know nothing about business, or you have something you need to work out.
110277	That was of no benefit to anyone. Why'd you waste your time?
110278	There is no profit in what you did.
110279	What you did was a total write-off.
110280	Greetings. Please, speak your mind.
110281	Welcome. I assume we have business to discuss?
110282	Hello. You wished to speak with me?
110283	Good to see you. So, what's on your mind?
110284	So nice of you to drop in. What can I do for you?
110285	Welcome. What was it you wanted to discuss?
110286	Please, come in. So, what did you want to see me about?
110287	Greetings. So, you wanted to talk with me. Please, go ahead.
110288	Hello. I understand you wished to speak with me. Please, feel free.
110289	Good of you to come by the office. What can I do for you?
110290	We will do our part.
110291	Very well. Count us in.
110292	The projections look good. It's a deal.
110293	Fine, consider us onboard.
110294	We're in.
110295	Agreed. I hope you will return the favor, at some point.
110296	Fine, I can approve your request. One hand washes the other.
110297	Very well. I am sure this will prove mutually beneficial.
110298	I was able to have your request approved.
110299	Certainly. Your request is sound business.
110300	I will have to refuse, thank you.
110301	I'm afraid I must refuse. I'm sorry.
110302	No, that is a request I cannot grant.
110303	It is unfortunate, I know, but the answer is no.
110304	Please understand, but I'm afraid I must say no.
110305	I hope you do not expect a positive answer.
110306	I am afraid I must refuse your request.
110307	Unfortunately, I cannot grant your request at this time.
110308	If you had wanted a positive answer, you would have prepared yourself better.
110309	I am certain that you knew I would not be able to grant your request.
110310	Have a seat please. We have to discuss your possible participation in this undertaking.
110311	Thank you for coming by. I have a business proposition for you.
110312	Good to see you. I have an assignment that I think might interest you.
110313	Hello. Please, have a seat. I have an assignment I think you might like.
110314	Look, I'll just cut to the chase. I have a project I think you'd be perfect for.
110315	Glad you're here. I could use someone competent for an assignment I have.
110316	I had hoped to find you here. And now I hope you will agree to take part in a little project.
110317	The fact that I left the office should indicate how important this assignment is.
110318	I was told I'd find you here. I have an assignment I'd like you to consider.
110319	Good, You're here. Then the trip was worth it. Interested in a little project?
110320	How serendipitous. I need someone reliable for an assignment, and here you are.
110321	Just the one I'd hoped to find. I have a project that promises to be mutually rewarding.
110322	All obligations were met, it seems.
110323	Excellent, you fulfilled the mission.
110324	You completed that assignment in an exemplary manner.
110325	Fast and efficient. That's the way to do business.
110326	I like the way you do business.
110327	A quick, efficient solution. I'll call you again when I need someone reliable.
110328	You did well. I think we should consider preferred partner status for you.
110329	Excellent work. I'll be sure to recommend you.
110330	I will have to reconsider the terms of our partnership.
110331	I do not hire people to deliver this kind of result.
110332	I need partners I can rely on. This last assignment gives me doubts...
113489	Why did you break off? You know how important this was...
113490	Why did you accept the job if you weren't going to finish it?
113491	Reliability is the cornerstone of business. You should know that.
110333	I am sure I don't have to remind you of your responsibilities.
110334	I don't want milestone reports, I want results.
110335	Time is wasting. Have you finished that project yet?
110336	Time is money, and both are flying out the window. Are you almost done?
110337	I hope you're here to give me the results of that assignment I gave you.
110338	Please finish that assignment. The delay is jeopardizing other projects.
110339	You still have an assignment on the books. Payment will only be made upon completion.
110340	Might I remind you that you still have some unfinished business to attend to?
110341	There it is.
110342	Yes, that's the object I mentioned.
110343	That is the asset in question, yes.
110344	I beg your pardon? Yes, that is the one I meant.
110345	Excellent. You found it.
110346	Yes, that is the one. Carry on.
110347	Right, that's it. You know what to do next.
110348	Very efficient. Now you've found it, on to the next step.
110349	Your destination.
110404	Please proceed to this location.
110405	This is where you will need to be for the next step.
110406	Exactly. That is your target location.
110407	That is where you will need to go.
110408	Right, that's the spot. Head on over there.
110409	Destination located. Proceed as planned.
110410	Right. That's the spot you'll need to visit.
110412	We could continue our cooperation, if you're interested.
110413	Excellent. If you're interested in surfing that success, I have a follow-up project for you.
110414	Well done. Your success has opened a window of opportunity for a new project. Want in?
110415	War has never led to anything good. But your intervention could probably lead to something less bad...
110416	Right. I'm afraid I need someone to put a permanent end to some bad business. You up for it?
110417	Violence is always bad for business. That's why I want you to go in and put an end to it.
110418	The area has become unsafe for business. Your job is to pacify the sector and make it safe.
110419	Armed conflict is bad for business. Take care of it.
110420	Well, you certainly advocated your position on the matter, even if it was through heavy fire.
110421	Excellent. Now that the area has been pacified, business can return to normal.
110422	Well done. Now shipping can once again transit the area unmolested.
110423	You consider such an outcome worth the losses?
110424	Losses are usually the result of neglecting contingencies.
110425	Next time you might want to prepare yourself better.
110426	We normally do not enter joint ventures, but we need a reliable partner for this.
110427	Our confidence in you proved well justified.
110428	I should have prevented this venture from becoming so dependent on your leadership.
110429	It was a business decision, pure and simple.
110430	I am a businessman, and it's my job to turn a profit for the company I work for.
110431	A controlled market is a predictable market – and a profitable market.
110432	Purely an attempt to prevent a glut on the market with the attendant drop in price.
110433	In business, such measures are sometimes necessary.
110434	An artificially inflated price can distort the market if supplies are limited.
110435	Goods in the marketplace are goods in circulation. That promotes consumption, and thereby production.
110436	A competitor was trying to create a shortage in order to monopolize the market. We countered.
110437	The lower the price, the broader the access. That in turn fosters new market segments.
110438	Bulk selling. Better to sell 10,000 units at 1 credit each than 1,000 units at 6 credits each.
110439	At Saayman International, we like to say we feed the world. We're feeding humanity. And as humanity reaches for the stars, we'll be there.
110440	Saayman has always been about food. We always will be. Wherever mankind ventures, Saayman will make sure it never hungers.
110441	Food was a logical choice for Saayman. As long as the population continues to grow, so will the market.
110442	Our race is now reaching out into space. One thing we know for certain: they will be hungry. That's where we come in.
110443	We're Saayman International. We feed the world. Yesterday, today, tomorrow – forever.
110444	I must admit, I'm somewhat astounded. Saayman Industries feeds the world. That is certainly worth supporting.
110445	If there were ever a company worth supporting, then it's Saayman. We're in the business of making sure no one goes hungry.
110446	If you're not willing to support the company that puts food on everyone's plate, just what do you support?
110447	You seem astute enough. Why aren't you supporting Saayman International?
110448	Saayman International has been a profitable partner for you. Is that not worthy of support?
110449	We truly appreciate your support. Rest assured, Saayman International understands that loyalty is a two-way street.
110450	I would like to thank you for your support, both personally and on behalf of Saayman International.
110451	You have proven yourself to be both skilled and astute. Saayman is proud to call you friend.
110452	Good business relations are built upon mutual trust. Thank you for your support.
110453	Thank you for your support. It's hard to find someone who understands the dictates of the business world.
110454	You won't see me making flowery speeches expounding what we do. Our achievements can be seen everywhere, in the happy faces of well-fed people. Saayman International. We feed the world.
110455	If anyone understands the pressures of an overfull calendar, it is I. Still, the few minutes it takes to vote can have a profound effect on the marketplace.
110456	Not only does Saayman International feed a great many people, we also employ a great many people, too. People working for people, for a better tomorrow.
110457	Saayman International? We are the food people. Day for day, we ensure that everyone has enough to eat. We feed the world.
110458	Saayman International arose in response to a need. People were starving. We vowed to put an end to that and will not stop until we've done so.
110459	Saayman International believes that only a well-fed man can attain his full potential.
110460	No child should ever have to go to bed hungry. To this end we dedicate Saayman International.
110461	At Saayman International we declared war on starvation, and we were victorious.
110462	Saayman International is one of the world's fastest growing corporations. No wonder. Everyone needs to eat.
110463	As mankind gears up for the next frontier, more workers are needed – and they all need to be fed.
110464	Short term, fiscally questionable growth is no substitute for a sound, viable business model.
110465	At Saayman International we cannot allow ourselves high-risk ventures. When one feeds humanity, there is no room for error.
110466	All the wealth in the world is useless if it can't buy you a meal.
110467	You may recall the story of the tortoise and the hare.
110468	Popularity and media attention often indicate more style than substance.
110469	Food is perhaps not the most exciting field to many, but no one wants to go without.
110470	There is no shame in falling behind Saayman International. You should instead be proud to measure yourself against a world leader.
110471	Ever been hungry? Really hungry? Is it any wonder we're so successful?
110472	What can I say? We feed the world. And they love us.
110473	Saayman International cares about people, and people care about us.
110474	Don't be too upset. What is more lovable than feeding the hungry?
110475	Is it any wonder? I mean, we feed the world. Think about it.
110476	The worldwide demand for food increases daily. We supply that need. Who doesn't like that?
110477	You're playing with the big kids now. It will take some time to grow into it.
110478	You are growing at an admirable pace. But you still have a ways to go.
110479	I can still remember the cut and thrust of climbing the ladder. Hang in there and you'll make it someday.
110480	Congratulations on your success. Despite our innovations, the food industry remains a slow growth sector. Albeit one that never falters.
110481	Saayman International feeds the world. That is a sacred trust, not a footrace.
110482	Fortune favors the bold, and when you're fighting starvation, there is no room for the timid.
110483	Nothing makes friends faster than feeding a hungry mouth. The Saayman secret.
110484	I respect our competitors. Saayman International is in excellent company amid the world's top corporations. Yet, I do wonder how long there will continue to be five of us... Between depleted resources and alleged debts, Saayman seems more relevant than ever.
110485	Hunger was commonplace in the neighborhood where I grew up. In the time I've worked at Saayman International, that has changed.
110486	It is hard to contribute to world culture and science when you are weak with hunger. The privileged mistake this for personal failure, choosing to ignore that it might have been them under different circumstances.
110487	I never cared for the old half hearted attempts to combat world hunger. It all just ended up causing more harm than help. Anyway, I'm not one to hold a grudge.
110488	With space as our next frontier, mankind will need all the manpower it can muster. Saayman International will be there to feed them.
110489	Food is one of the basic rights. It doesn't have to be free, but it must be available!
110490	As a boy, I dreamed of being able to eat whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Another reason I joined Saayman.
110491	What boy did not dream of one day being an astronaut? It's too late for me, but at least I can feed them!
110492	I joined Saayman International to make a difference, to help feed the people I saw starving. I'm proud to say that we are doing just that.
110493	I met Jay Saayman when I was still a young man. One of the best days of my life.
110494	I don't envy Bharghava's position. Limited resources aside, being someone's lapdog instead of your own person must be degrading. Then again, I doubt he realises it. Ignorance is bliss, after all.
110495	I admire May Tian's will. It must be iron, keeping her business among the world's largest as she does. If I were you, I'd do my best not to cross her.
110496	It's saddening to see how disdainful some people can be of others' hunger when their own bellies are full.
110497	Hofwegen is a gifted and studious scientist, but so very wasteful. She places no value in efficiency nor relevance in her inventions. Headhunting her would be a mistake.
113492	Un-detected. You were supposed to remain undetected.
113493	You were seen. All of the resources poured into this assignment - lost.
113494	You were detected. That was a waste of time and money.
113495	Excellent, you're in the area indicated. Start your search.
113496	Now that you've arrived, you can begin your search.
113497	Right on time. Now find the object as quickly as possible.
113498	You found it. Excellent work!
113499	You found it already? Now, that was efficient!
113500	You were quick in finding that. Excellent use of the available resources.
115076	Good day. We haven't met before. My name is Emem Buhari. That's Emem with two Ms. I am the External Affairs Officer at Saayman International, so I'm sure I'll be dealing with you more frequently in the future.
115353	Please contact me. It is about our joint project...
115354	Visit our project site. The next few steps are your responsibility.
115355	Please concentrate your attention on our joint venture.
115356	Please contact me, if your time allows. I'll be waiting here.
115357	I have a proposal for you, if you're interested.
115358	Saayman International is planning a project in this sector. We hope you will participate.
115507	We want to break routes straight through the ice. When our competitors caught wind of it they called us madmen, but your presence here makes it possible.
115509	Together we will convince the Arctic Custodians we're up to the job. Now, of course, these new routes will be just as much yours as ours.
115510	Please don't jump to conclusions about our values, this is a project for sustainability. We don't seek to destroy, we want to supply. I trust we have your support?
115512	These channels will help us feed the world! I'll be in touch when the second channel is ready.
115513	We've secured the first step towards our people's sustenance. I'll let you know when we're ready to continue.
115514	Even with two operational channels we can barely meet the demand. Saayman International will prepare the construction of a third, shorter one. You'll hear from me.
115515	Constructing the third route requires a certain delicacy, but it's progressing well. I'll inform you should your help be required.
115516	All three channels are secure and working at capacity to provide for our people. On behalf of Saayman International, I thank you for your partnership.
115519	These channels are a beacon for trade in the Arctic. It's my duty to make sure they stay safe. You helped us in our hour of need, I shall not forget that.
115525	I expected to see you here. Let me explain my case: Saayman International hopes to expand the Arctic's food supply network, in partnership with you.
115888	Congratulations on your success. It just goes to show that we should all strive towards excellence.
105392	The Crew's in the house! Ready to build one hell of a space port!
111987	Great!
111988	That's really something!
111989	Thumbs up!
111990	Nice work!
111991	Nothing to sneeze at.
111992	Gotta like that!
111993	Couldn't be better!
111994	Decent work here.
111995	Respect.
111996	That's how it's done!
111997	That's definitely an improvement!
111999	Good that's over. Stuff like that can make you crazy.
112000	So that's the end of that, eh? Finally.
112001	You're a real champ!
112002	It's great, the way you always pitch in to help. Thanks for that.
112003	You just made my day!
112004	Always good to have you on the job!
112005	You always know how to handle stuff like this!
112006	Worked out nicely, thanks to you.
112007	There's nothing you can't make happen, eh?
112008	Thanks for all your efforts!
112009	And then you just come round and save the day. Great!
112010	You have my greatest respect.
112011	That bites!
112012	[Sigh] It is what it is.
112013	Too bad.
112014	That is so messed up!
112015	No good.
112016	Didn't work out.
112017	You're joking, right?
112018	Ah, one of those days...
112019	Ah, crap!
112020	Ah, no!
112021	Woah, that's a case for the union, you know?
112022	With all due respect, just how'd you think that would turn out?
112023	You should have called a specialist. Sorry, but...
112024	You did your best.
112025	We all have those days, you know...
112026	And I just bragged about how successful my boss is...
112027	Sorry. I reckon you worked hard on that.
112028	You'll nail it next time.
112029	Not saying you fouled up, but... look at the mess...
112030	Blame it on the tools, boss.
112031	Got some work for me?
112032	Didn't expect the management to show up. Please, come in...
112033	Sorry, you must be accustomed to more comfort.
112034	Been some time since I had such an important guest. What can I do for ya?
112035	My humble four walls. Come in and sit a spell.
112036	So, right, then. How's things?
112037	Welcome. Hope everything's alright.
112038	Hi. There any work to do?
112039	Seems like work is following me home, now. But I don't mind.
112040	It's a good day. All the more so, now that you dropped in.
112041	Time to roll up our sleeves!
112042	Here goes!
112043	Wait, I'll just go grab my toolbox.
112044	Of course.
112045	I'll get it done.
112046	You got it!
112047	You can count on me!
112048	You pay my bills, don't ya?
112049	For you, anytime!
112050	You bet!
112051	Now, of all times? No, sorry.
112052	Sorry, too much other stuff to do.
112053	No way.
112054	Sorry, not my kind of thing.
112055	No. Sorry.
112056	Sorry, I already clocked out, you see?
112057	You didn't hire me to do anything like that!
112058	I reckon you got better qualified people for that.
112059	Sorry, I'm kinda overworked right now, see?
112060	I'd like to help you. But the doc says I gotta ease up.
112061	I'm gonna need some help from the management here.
112062	I know you're very busy. But you can't just close your eyes to this!
112063	I wish someone would take care of that.
112064	This makes work all the harder. Would you do something about it?
112065	I'd rather report the problem before they say the tradesmen botched it up.
112066	Now, I ain't normally one to call for a strike, but if this problem ain't tackled soon...
112067	Thanks! That really helped!
112068	Good to know we have people like you upstairs!
112069	Stiff piece of work, that. But you nailed it!
112070	That's what I call work ethic! Thanks!
112071	See, that's why I'm glad I work for you!
112072	You always take our matters seriously. Thanks for that!
112073	Woah, that was a real walkover for you!
112074	Great job! Thanks a lot!
112075	Sorry, but that was some pretty shoddy work.
112076	[Sigh] Happens to the best of us.
112077	All that work and nothing to show for it!
112078	Yeah, why burn yourself out for the little people, eh?
112079	And I thought, it would get done finally.
112080	Yeah, yeah, right... Back to work...
112081	You haven't forgotten me, have ya?
112082	Yeah, you owe it to yourself to take five every now and then on a job like that.
112083	Taking some time off work?
112084	How far along are you?
112085	Work going well?
112086	Always nice to have you here. But ain't there work to do?
112087	Can't wait to see when everything's done!
112088	What, quittin' time already?
112089	Yeah, that'd be it.
112090	Looks like the one, eh?
112091	That's it.
112092	Guess that's it, alright.
112093	Careful. That stuff's important.
112094	Right, that's it.
112095	All packed up and ready to go.
112096	Ready for the taking.
112097	Right there, yup.
112098	Told the guys you're on the way.
112099	Yeah, over there!
112100	Looks like you know your way around.
112101	Already expecting you.
112102	I reckon you're on the right path.
112103	Over there, over there!
112104	That's the spot, boss.
112105	Ah, now they got us.
112106	Too much noise?
112107	Woah, they have good eyes.
112108	That's the direction.
112109	Must be around here, I reckon.
112110	Keep going!
112111	So that's how it looks like?
112112	Found it!
112113	Right there, ahead of us!
112116	So much for the groundwork. Now it's time to get down to brass tacks!
112117	Thanks a lot. But there's still another problem needs takin' care of.
112118	Great! Hope it isn't rude to ask for something else.
112119	There're so many attacks at sea these days... gives me the creeps.
112120	Not whinin' or nothin', but someone's gotta deal with this threat!
112121	Nothing you can solve with drill and hammer. Needs some guns, I reckon.
112122	Working at sea has become way too dangerous. Could you look into that?
112123	I know it's a big thing to ask, but could you ensure more safety at sea?
112124	And they all went boom. Nice work, boss!
112125	Tough as nails, you are!
112126	You made short work of those sleazebags!
112127	Those cowards, if I could just get my hands on them...
112128	Next time you'll pound them to smithereens!
112129	Woah, can't say I ain't nervous right now.
112131	There's some serious mismanagement going on. And it's us regular Joes who take the rap.
112132	Prosperity for everyone... yeah, right!
112133	That does it! I've had enough! I quit!
112134	And the bosses just ignore our concerns! Same as always.
112135	Yeah, sure, keep ignoring our basic employment rights!
112136	Oh, an honorable visitor! Say, did you see any of that welfare you promised us around here anywhere?
112137	Staff restructuring? Ah, gimme a break!
112139	Our block gets emptier every day. Kinda makes you think.
112142	How am I doing? Hmm, well – I'm not dead...
112144	Yeah, my joints are killin' me, but at least I have a job.
112143	Life's not easy here, but we can make something out of it.
112130	We bust our backs all day! And for what?
112138	So a wise man once said if you can't have fun, there's no sense in doing it? Yeah, right.
112145	There's always room for improvement. That's what my foreman says.
112146	It's alright here, I guess. Nothing fancy.
112147	Can't really complain, but I'm not jumpin' for joy, either.
112148	I don't mind working here at all.
112149	Sure, you know, but everyone always wants a little more.
112150	A lot left to do if we wanna make this place special. But I'm confident we'll get there.
112151	I have a home, a job... guess you could say, I'm doin' good.
116488	Makes it easier, knowing I works in a place like this and for a boss like you.
116489	I can allow myself a litlle treat every so often. Life is good!
116490	I, for one, believe in our company.
116491	Me? Oh, yeah. I'm fine. Pretty good place to be.
116492	Kids are happy, the missus is fine. Really can't complain.
116493	This is the life you have here! Not one unhappy face out on the street.
116494	The cityscape alone! Pretty awesome.
116495	Look at all the things the company gives us. Can't take it all for granted, see?
116496	It's a beautiful day. Kind of has to be, in a place like this. Life is good.
116497	You being here at my house only shows how much you care for us!
112154	What can I say, it's just amazing here!
112155	They should vote you "Employer of the Year"!
112156	Really, I couldn't imagine living anywhere else!
112157	I like the morale at work. It's like we could accomplish anything!
112158	You know life is good when you can be certain that people will smile back at you on the street.
112159	At first, my wife was skeptical, but when I showed her this city... her jaw literally dropped.
112160	And we owe it all to you! Thanks a lot!
112161	I don't have a lot of free time. And every day still feels like a holiday, here.
112162	We'll be the company that conquers the whole solar system! I know we will!
112163	It's not like working for a company. It's like helping a friend.
112166	My colleagues and I were just talking this morning about how we could use one of those nearby.
112167	Yeah, good to have one in the neighborhood!
112168	Thanks! I'll pay it a visit right away.
112169	Got work to do? We're on it!
112170	Nice apartments! Makes me look forward to quitting time.
112171	Someone called for some workers?
112172	I always dreamed about going to space when I was a kid. And now I'm working to make it come true, for all humanity!
112173	Manual labor's tough enough. But I don't wanna think about what those poor folks on the Moon have to go through.
112174	Got me some private projects at home, for relaxing. I'm building some furniture... and... redoing the roof... and... finishing the attic. You know, relaxing stuff.
112175	You tried that Ibarra-FoxCom Build-a-Bot kit? Impossible. I just don't have the patience for puzzles.
112176	Spaceports... those're big projects. I hear there's lots of work gangs that never see each other, just because they work in different areas of the construction site. Amazin'.
115548	I can't believe they'd treat us like this!
115549	Sorry, gotta dash, I can't lose this job now.
115550	Maybe I should rake in my overtime benefits.
115551	Oh damn, where'd I put my keys?
115552	Time to reward myself with some takeout!
115553	Living on the Moon? Sounds pretty awesome!
115554	You bought meat? That's gonna be delicious!
115555	All these public holidays are pretty great.
115581	This was a big chunk, well done!
115582	Ouch, my thumb!
115583	That's a good one, we can use it.
115585	Oh, you'll get used to the smell.
115587	What do the results say?
115589	Let's get these crates moved!
115591	Don't spill those!
115602	Is all the paperwork filled out?
115603	Can I get a pair of hands over here?
115604	Did you see that? We should come more often!
115611	I'm so glad we still got tickets.
105397	Impressive progress! Now that the geeks are here, we can all start compartmentalizing and forming our little cliques!
112368	Wow!
112369	Perfect!
112370	A top notch performance!
112371	Incredible!
112372	That's sensational, really!
112373	There's no way anyone could have done better!
112374	Ten out of ten!
112375	Words fail me.
112376	How super!
112377	People will tell this story forever!
112379	Wow you solved it.
112380	Everyone is glad this is done with.
112381	The news spread like wildfire. It's over at last!
112382	You're definitely the leader type!
112383	I thought that was impossible. And then you did it.
112384	I don't know how you manage to do this!
112385	You'd better get ready for a lot of thank yous!
112386	Everything in the green, thanks to you!
112387	Sorry, but I just have to hug you!
112388	You are absolutely incredible!
112389	With you at the helm, how could anything go wrong!
112390	No doubt about it, you certainly know what you're doing!
112391	You hit it outta the park!
112392	Oh, please, no.
112393	Oh no. Not quite optimum. Not even close, to be honest.
112394	Oh snap!
112395	Oh, great.
112396	Wasn't meant to be.
112397	Next time.
112398	Seriously?
112399	Ouch!
112400	Don't think it could get any more out of control.
112401	[Sigh] I just want to go home.
112402	And I was so certain you would solve this.
112403	You're my employer, so I'd better not speak my mind about this.
112404	It's the thought that counts, you know.
112405	I know, I know, you do what you can.
112406	Well, at least you tried, I guess.
112407	Excuse me, where do I go to lodge a complaint?
112408	Pretty so-so, don't you think?
112409	Looks like you pushed the wrong buttons, huh?
112410	If you can't do it, I wonder who can.
112411	You failed. We've all been there.
112412	You, here, I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous.
112413	Can I get you something? Tea, coffee? Or can I do something for you?
112414	You should have let me know. I don't have anything in the fridge.
112415	You, here? And I haven't even cleaned up.
112416	Yes, is there something you want?
112417	So, how may I be of service?
112418	Well... This is a nice surprise. What... What can I do for you?
112419	You came to see me? I didn't expect that, to be honest.
112420	Is there something the matter at work?
112421	Oh, welcome.
112422	Right away.
112423	Anytime.
112424	Query confirmed.
112425	Understood.
112426	Okay. All systems go!
112427	You'll be happy.
112428	Your wish is my command. Within reason.
112429	As you like.
112430	Why certainly.
112431	I'll inform you when it's done.
112433	Operation not feasible, sorry
112434	Couldn't find a replacement, sorry.
112435	Sorry, no.
112436	I can't. Have to monitor the systems.
112437	Other priorities, sorry.
112438	Sorry to tell you, but that's impossible right now.
112439	Sorry, I have to put your request on hold.
112440	Normally, I wouldn't refuse you... but... work, you see?
112441	Please, don't be cross with me.
112442	You see, I'm pretty overworked as it is.
112443	I've had this on the radar for a while. Could you take care of it?
112444	I know, it hasn't gone through the official channels. But it is important.
112445	The required channels proved ineffective. That's why I approached you directly.
112446	Excuse me? Excuse me. I wanted to pass along this request, if you don't mind.
112447	This just came in. Looks pretty urgent.
112448	Please don't consider me cheeky. I just thought I'd better ask you in person.
112449	Process concluded! Thank you very much!
112450	Everything back in working order! Thank you!
112451	Whew, that was a five star performance!
112452	Whoa, your thank you's are piling up!
112453	Thank you. You really pulled out all the stops!
112454	The emergency indicator is dropping again! You did it!
112455	Wow. Thank you!
112456	Operations are running smoothly again. You certainly saw to that!
112457	[Sigh] Suboptimal.
112458	Disappointed? No, no! Well... yeah.
112459	They're already gossiping pretty viciously around here.
112460	Oh... I see... too bad...
112461	Of course. I'm sure you have more important things to do...
112462	No input. No output.
112463	Any progress? Shall I update the database?
112464	You have all the required information?
112465	The status indicator reads "In progress". You're on it, then?
112466	Can I set it to "done", or do you still need time?
112467	Oh, it's you. Is there any news regarding the assignment?
112468	It's in the pipeline? Well, if you say so...
112469	I know you're a busy person. But I hope you find the time for this soon.
112470	I hope you're not stuck or something.
112471	Confirmed. This is it.
112472	According to the database, you found the right one.
112473	Data collation shows a match.
112474	It looks like the one specified, at least.
112475	Checked it. It's the right one.
112476	We have that one in the assignment survey.
112477	The tracking number's correct. That should be it.
112478	Oh, yes, I think that's it.
112479	Location confirmed.
112480	Heads-up memo is out. They're expecting you.
112481	Coordinates transmitted.
112482	Confirmation received. This is the target location.
112483	Seems you don't need any further directions.
112484	All is prepared for your arrival, it seems.
112485	Let's go!
112486	Yes, get there, please.
112487	They've detected us.
112488	They have us on their radars.
112489	Mission cancelled. They know our position.
112490	Almost there, according to the data.
112491	It's close by here, I'm sure.
112492	It's here, somewhere within our radius.
112493	Object detected.
112494	Confirmed. You found it.
112495	Located.
112496	Thank you. Unfortunately, the data indicates that the problem has not been solved completely.
112497	Thank you! How about taking on another task, now all processes are up and running?
112498	Incredible! You don't mind me bothering you again, do you?
112499	The marine radio messages coming in say it's a real battlefield out there. Are you willing to help?
112500	The hazard display for oversea travel is in the red. Shouldn't someone do something?
112501	The data indicates a critical increase of military incidents. Not good.
112502	It's a lot to ask of you, but we don't feel particularly safe anymore.
112503	When will someone put an end to all this pointless fighting?
112504	Whew, let's hope we have seen our share of violence for a while.
112505	Just came in. Congratulations for your victory.
112506	Reports are in. You were victorious straight across the board.
112507	The damage reports are disastrous. And the casualties... I'll keep quiet about that.
112508	So much for the futility of war...
112509	Thanks for putting your head on the block for us. I'm glad you still have it.
112510	We're surrounded by cutting edge technology. But on a human level... this feels like the middle ages.
112512	People quit and I get stuck with all the work. If it at least paid off.
112513	My life is like the vending machine in our break room: Push buttons all day and for what? Nothing.
112514	Oh yeah, a spaceport on the doorstep. Ever tried to actually reach for the stars here?
112515	It's not just me! My whole department is fed up!
112516	Cheap housing, challenging duties, yeah! Sounds nice on paper, but in reality.
112517	I lost count of how many complaints I've filed.
112519	I hope you came to hand me my pink slip. I want out of here!
112511	[Sigh] All the promises that were made...
112518	I asked around. Other firms provide much better working conditions.
112520	It's not all sunshine and roses here. But I get along.
112525	I make a living. What else can I expect?
112528	We could make this an even better place to be. But with all the work.
112521	Get up, go to work, go home. The usual.
112522	Not bad here, for the most part.
112523	Things are fine here but there's something... can't quite put my finger on it.
112524	I think we all get along with one another pretty well here.
112526	Sometimes I feel like there's something missing.
112527	Happiness? That's a big word.
112529	On the whole, it's a decent workplace.
112530	I have no reason to complain!
112531	I like my job, I like my home. Those are pretty nice feelings to have.
112532	Oh, I don't mind having visitors. People around here are all so nice.
112533	I have the feeling our needs are taken seriously here.
112534	Just keep smiling. It's not all that hard here.
112535	Yes, I've had a pretty good day so far. No wonder.
112536	I'm in a really good mood.
112537	I think we have a bright future ahead of us.
112538	Everything is in apple-pie order. Thanks to you.
112539	Nothing to report. We are all doing pretty fine.
112540	The wages, the climate at work, talk about a plum job!
112541	How couldn't I want to work for you!
112542	Thank you for making all this possible!
112543	And I came to live here! Lucky me!
112544	I have a few days off, but I can't wait to go back to work. I love it!
112545	Motivation is at an all-time high!
112546	Your space colonies will be a hit, judging from how incredible it is down here.
112547	I love taking walks through our city, just to take in its beauty.
112548	You rock! You totally rock!
112549	Honestly, could it even get any better?
112711	Thanks. We really missed having something like this.
112712	Wow. I must say I'll sleep much better tonight.
112713	You keep the streets safe. Thank you!
112714	Operators at your service!
112715	All systems online! Can't wait to get started.
112716	Okay, let's set things in motion!
112717	Lately, we've shifted from touchpad to voice command systems. Makes the job easier, unless you're hoarse.
112718	After a day staring at monitors, nothing beats reading a book, you know. They're one of those weird, costly historical hobbies.
112719	Running a space program involves millions of technical processes all having to unfold in perfect synchronicity. Good thing you have us.
112720	To the Moon? No thanks. I'm a down-to-earth person, myself.
115556	They're talking about redundancies.
115557	I can't do my job like this!
115558	And pile after pile after pile of paper...
115559	Why do my plants keep dying?
115560	Let's apply for some vacation time!
115561	We should definitely get a second coffee machine.
115562	New appartment: check!
115563	I could get used to going out for dinner.
115584	Hey, keep that helmet on!
115586	We've got a couple hundred orders to go.
115588	Stay away from those batteries!
115590	Good, contamination's at a minimum.
115593	I need a new container for this.
115594	Careful with the dust.
115596	Yeah, that's a lot of water.
115597	Alright, the flow is stable.
115598	Sending off in 3... 2... 1...
115599	Vacuum these, thanks.
115600	Stop stacking crates there, there's more space over here.
115601	It's a tight schedule, but we'll make it.
115605	C'mon, let's skip the ads.
115607	Okay, where did you last see him?
115610	Of course, more delays.
115791	Leave the bureaucracy to us. You should use your leadership skills to get those colony shuttles into space.
112732	An excellent solution.
112733	Excellent.
112734	It worked.
112735	Very efficient.
112736	Good.
112737	That will definitely yield something.
112738	So far, so good.
112739	Well done.
112740	A definite win!
112741	Perfect.
112742	Then we can shelve this, finally.
112743	If that isn't good news.
112744	Fewer restrictions. Excellent.
112745	You are heading for success!
112746	Without you, that wouldn't have gone so smoothly.
112747	Our shares are rising!
112748	And again, our corporation makes the headlines!
112749	You always know what to do. I am impressed.
112750	There is no problem you can't solve, am I right?
112751	That only shows your talent as a leader.
112752	You have accomplished so much for the company. Thank you.
112753	You do things right!
112754	You made this enterprise a success!
112755	And it all started so promisingly.
112756	What a setback.
112757	Pointless and profitless.
112758	Oh, for crying out loud!
112759	An economic catastrophe!
112760	A huge outlay with no return.
112761	I can see the red ink right in front of me!
112762	How could it come to this?
112763	Terrible.
112764	Well, I hope things will get better.
112766	And there goes your careful plan.
112767	You should have delegated that.
112768	I hope we can somehow compensate for this.
112769	This will affect our market value...
112770	Not your personal best, if I may say so.
112771	I don't question your decisions... But what was the point?
112772	You know what that means for the company?
112773	Your approach was unrealistic, to begin with.
112774	You'd better have planned for this outcome, as well.
112775	I'm sure you had the best intentions.
112776	Ah, good day. What can I do for you?
112777	Ah, welcome. Is there something to discuss?
112778	My pleasure. Please, take a chair.
112779	A meeting, here in my home? Well, why not!
112780	Won't you come inside?
112781	Something official? Or are you just dropping by?
112782	Do we have an appointment? Oh, never mind... come in!
112783	I can always make time for you!
112784	Yes, please?
112785	So, how is business?
112786	Say no more.
112787	I will take care of it immediately.
112788	Of course.
112789	I have assigned it a high priority.
112790	I put someone on the matter.
112791	As you wish.
112792	I will have someone see to it for you.
112793	Yes. I will keep you briefed.
112794	If you want to delegate that to me, sure.
112795	You can trust me on this.
112796	That would cause some problems with my schedule.
112797	Not now. Please make an appointment!
112798	Not at the moment.
112799	I am sorry, but I am very busy.
112800	Sorry, I have too much on my desk as it is.
112801	I'm sorry, but I have to disappoint you.
112802	Please, don't count on it happening.
112803	You have to understand that the department needs my full attention.
112804	Sorry, I don't have any staff I can spare you right now.
112805	I hate to cancel on you, but I must.
112806	I don't want the responsibility. This is for you to look after.
112807	That is a top-level issue.
112808	The time has been assigned to leave you free to take care of everything.
112809	It's already making itself felt on the markets. You have to act.
112810	Our shareholders would like you to interpose.
112811	Our staff is growing nervous about this.
112812	You really should give yourself a bonus for that!
112813	Our company stands for excellence. And so does our CEO.
112814	You are the future of the world economy!
112815	Thank you! Everybody will profit from that!
112816	What can I say? Excellent!
112817	Please accept my congratulations.
112818	Everything looks very good. Thank you!
112819	I suppose it pays to leave these matters to the boss!
112820	I hope we are covered legally.
112821	From bad to worse.
112822	Now, how am I supposed to explain this to our shareholders?
112823	Schedule difficulties, I presume?
112824	We cannot procrastinate forever.
112825	Fine, I'll have everything canceled.
112826	So, what are the prospects?
112827	The prognoses look promising. How far along are you with the implementation?
112828	Of course. Here is another dossier on the matter...
112829	You want to discuss this matter again?
112830	The press has been asking. What can I tell them about your progress?
112831	I don't want to seem impatient, but I have to report back to the shareholders.
112832	What is the status on that assignment?
112833	Several departments are demanding updated information. Any news?
112834	This is the one, I suppose.
112835	You have located it.
112836	Everything's where it's supposed to be.
112837	All ready for delivery.
112838	Exactly.
112839	Nothing escapes you, it seems.
112840	It seems like the one on the assignment form.
112841	Please, take care of this one.
112842	Everybody is preparing for your arrival, I hear.
112843	It seems you don't need directions.
112844	This way.
112845	My secretary has already announced your arrival.
112846	You are awaited.
112847	Yes, this the exact location.
112848	I cannot send someone. You have to go yourself.
112849	This is the place mentioned.
112850	They have found us.
112851	We're not spending enough on camouflage systems, it seems.
112852	You acted too suspicious.
112853	You are on the right path.
112854	Yes, it must be in the vicinity.
112855	Our search will soon be at an end.
112856	That's what we were looking for.
112857	That seems to be it.
112858	Definitely. That must be it.
112859	Thank you. Now that I have your ear, could you see about this as well?
112860	Very good. But this matter requires some additional attention.
112861	I see this requires a multi-step solution.
112862	These people are a danger to the company!
112863	This threatens our routes as well. I hope you intervene soon.
112864	I'm afraid we will not solve this issue without military action.
112865	The staff hopes you won't turn a blind eye to this menace.
112866	Our shareholders demand that you put an end to this violence.
112867	I congratulate you on this victory.
112868	Hm, your strategies pay off on the battlefield, as well.
112869	A heavy-handed response, I would say.
112870	This will burn a hole in our military budget.
112871	Such a loss.
112872	We underestimated the opposition.
112873	Everyone is always complaining! I am sick and tired of it!
112874	Overtime again! Someone must smooth out all the directors' mistakes!
112875	Please, if you'll excuse me, I have to go fire some people!
112877	It's my job to make decisions for them. But I am just as helpless against this... hysteria.
112878	The responsibility nags at you, now that everything is going to the dogs...
112880	If it keeps going on like this, I'll take it to the labor court.
112881	Expenses this high and no comfort to show for them, either!
112882	You're playing with peoples' livelihoods here!
112876	My employees constantly ask me about their futures! Do I look like I have the answers?
112884	They say we decision makers sit around all day. But it's still work.
112887	Between us, this enterprise could be so much more!
112889	My career just goes round in circles. But never mind.
112891	I had imagined a leadership position to be more... satisfying.
112883	The numbers look alright. I won't complain.
112885	I think everything is well organized here.
112886	I've been in worse companies, certainly.
112888	The atmosphere? About what you'd expect.
112890	A meeting? I wouldn't know what to talk about.
112892	What is to say? Everything is the way it always is.
112893	I thought about a home office. But then I wouldn't get out to see the beautiful cityscape.
112894	I got a bonus recently, so yes, I'm doing fine!
112895	I had the complaint box removed. It was always empty anyway.
112896	We're doing some good business at the moment. Sure, that affects our mood.
112897	I have built myself quite a good life here, wouldn't you say?
112898	I had big windows installed in the meeting rooms. Seeing this skyline creates ideas.
112899	People often approach me for raises. I'm glad I can grant them.
112900	What's not to like about this company?
112901	Business trips? Yes. But I would miss the office, certainly.
112902	I really like it here. This atmosphere of contentedness.
112903	No matter what perks they offer me... I wouldn't work for anyone else!
112904	Cancel all my appointments! I have to buy this incredible CEO here a lunch!
112905	You really are exemplary! Both as an employer and as a person!
112906	I am certain there will be lots of opportunities for us all in the future!
112907	The company is just like one big family! And I'm a family kind of person, you know?
112908	I always wanted a job with guaranteed chances of advancement!
112909	Thanks for all you have done for us!
112910	I don't know how you do this!
112911	All the important decisions! And I have a voice in them!
112912	What a city!
112913	A good choice! We don't have enough of those.
112914	I take it you read the infrastructure reports. Very good!
112915	That will take the edge off rush hour. Thank you!
112916	May I introduce myself?
112917	I am looking forward to working with you.
112918	Thank you for the opportunity.
112919	The Big Five divided the world markets amongst themselves. So we'll just open new markets in space, right?
112920	I saw a computer simulation of how they did business in the 15th century. I should definitely get myself a sailing ship.
112921	Between you and me, the big enterprises are the powers that be in the world today. We shouldn't miss our chance.
112922	The energy market will likely collapse soon. I'm glad I get my electricity directly from you and not from Liu Xing.
112923	Sometimes I get tired of all the old clichés: All managers fly sports cars and play PlasmaTag all day.
115565	A small miracle the economy hasn't collapsed yet.
115566	Cutting salaries isn't fun for me, either.
115567	Alright, but just a short lunch break.
115568	Why won't the baby sitter pick up?
115569	This city is beautiful, I should go out more.
115570	Smaller than Earth, but so impressive...
115571	Can't wait for the trip, better get ready!
115572	I feel like I should try cooking tonight.
115595	We'll order more desinfectants.
115606	We'll see what we can do.
115609	No! I almost made it! This is illogical!
115977	Well, that's quite a sum... but, your stellar career should be guarantee enough that our money is well-invested.
115294	My, what a lovely atmosphere! Figuratively speaking, of course.
115295	I've seen many familiar faces amongst the other guests. All celebrities from the world of business and politics.
115296	I hope we don't have to eat out of plastic bags as well. These natives simply don't understand culinary culture.
115302	I don't understand. The battery indicator said we could go another mile.
115306	There are a lot of cameras in this vehicle. Can I buy a video of this later on?
115307	There's always a risk involved in such trips. I'm just glad I don't need to listen to people telling me their life story anymore.
112956	Wow, what can I say...
112957	Very pleasing to hear.
112958	Kudos!
112959	That exceeded my boldest assumptions.
112960	Good!
112961	Outstanding!
112962	Bravo!
112963	My recommendations!
112974	Very well done!
112975	Superb!
112976	This is the outcome I was hoping for.
112977	A change like this was long overdue.
112978	At last.
112979	You never fail to impress me!
112980	Here's to you!
112981	A toast to your success!
112982	Allow me to congratulate you.
112983	My compliments to you.
112984	Don't be modest!
112985	You have not disappointed me.
112986	You brightened my day.
112987	I like your style of leadership!
112988	Well, you do live up to your reputation.
112989	What next!
112990	What a pity.
112991	I'd rather not think about the consequences.
112992	Outrageous!
112993	Unacceptable!
112994	A catastrophe!
112995	I suppose I celebrated too soon.
112996	So much for my good mood.
112997	Oh, please...
112998	All I can do is shake my head.
112999	And I always believed in you...
113000	Excuse me, but are you out of your mind?
113001	At least you tried.
113002	I'm sure you meant well.
113003	That was a complete flop, you know.
113004	How dare you!
113005	I could find words to make you feel better, but I won't...
113006	Don't even try to justify your performance.
113007	Go ahead, explain yourself!
113008	And I thought you were more of a winner.
113009	Please, be my guest.
113010	Now that is a familiar face...
113011	Do we know each oth... oh, yes, it's you, of course.
113012	I'm sure it's important...
113013	The pleasure is all mine.
113014	I would have sent for you anyhow.
113015	Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
113016	It's no bother. I enjoy playing host.
113017	Of course, stay as long as you like.
113018	Well, I can spare some time. What do you need?
113072	Very well, then.
113073	I've made up my mind. Yes.
113074	I'll see what I can do.
113075	Well, I wouldn't want to disappoint you, so sure...
113076	I have the means, so why shouldn't I?
113077	You have my full support.
113078	But just this once, you hear me.
113079	As long as you don't expect me to delight in it.
113080	Well, if you ask so blatantly.
113081	You're welcome.
113082	The very idea!
113083	Absolutely not!
113084	That is beyond my power.
113085	I have to firmly reject this.
113086	I don't promote things like this.
113087	You cannot demand such a thing.
113088	You cannot possibly be serious!
113089	Don't expect me to support you in this matter.
113090	Sorry. You can't always get what you want.
113091	I like your sense of humor... oh, you're serious...
113092	The whole world is watching this matter unfold. We should seize the opportunity.
113093	Now you can show your true worth.
113094	Can I entrust you with something this important?
113095	I would be more comfortable if I knew the matter was in good hands.
113096	This has the highest priority.
113097	Please, take care of the details.
113098	What you accomplished here was most admirable.
113099	I see you can be relied upon!
113100	Apparently, my confidence in you was justified.
113101	I assure you of my gratitude.
113102	You have surpassed even yourself.
113103	You have a way of solving problems that I find very refreshing!
113104	You have accomplished all there is to accomplish!
113105	Your diligence deserves respect.
113106	[Sigh] So much misguided potential!
113107	You should ask yourself why...
113108	Well, curiosity kills the company, or something like that.
113109	I already pumped money in to this project!
113110	It's back and forth with you.
113111	I demand an explanation.
113112	Thank you for keeping me informed. Is there anything new?
113113	I am certain you are making every effort to find a solution.
113114	I have other appointments, so are we done? Or are you, for that matter?
113115	Finish what you start. You are familiar with that saying, I hope?
113116	Here again? I don't know if I should feel flattered or let down.
113117	You take the matter seriously, I hope.
113118	I can see progress... Slow, but it is progress.
113119	Give me an estimate. How much longer will this take you?
113120	This is it, most certainly.
113121	Yes.
113122	Good. You found it.
113123	Impossible to overlook, isn't it?
113124	Well, seek and ye shall find.
113125	Please, be very careful with it.
113126	You have a good eye for such things.
113127	Well, you have this for a start.
113128	Did you invest in a modern navigation system?
113129	This is your destination, yes.
113130	Your destination.
113131	That is where I expect you to go.
113132	I hope you reach it in time.
113133	Please, set out immediately.
113134	It won't take you long, I hope.
113135	What are you waiting for?
113136	You're not to be overlooked, are you?
113137	Very sneaky, oh yes...
113138	Oh no, they've detected you.
113139	From here, it is only a short distance.
113140	Hurry. You almost have it.
113141	You have come to this point. Now go on.
113142	This far and no further.
113143	I must say, you are something of a treasure hunter.
113144	Very good. You found it at least.
113145	Outstanding. Now, if you could turn your attention to this...
113146	Bravo! But the matter is not yet completely resolved.
113147	Ahead of schedule. You should have enough time for this as well, then.
113148	I demand that you show no mercy!
113149	All talks have failed. Still, actions speak louder than words.
113150	Take the appropriate measures, however dire they may be.
113151	This threatens more than just our profits, if you get my drift.
113152	Someone must put a stop to this warmongering!
113153	Your will to prevail certainly deserves praise!
113154	Formidable. In every sense of the word.
113155	So much dedication!
113156	The loss of lives. How sad.
113157	Could you refrain from such... fatal adventures in the future?
113158	I've prepared letters of condolence.
113159	You are responsible for this!
113160	Seriously? This is what I invested in?
113161	Not to put too fine a point on it... horrible.
113162	Leave me alone! Or is privacy a scarcity as well?
113163	Not another word about my living conditions!
113165	I've been in golf clubs that are more livable.
113166	A booming city. I can hear crashing and exploding all around me!
113167	This place is... unacceptable.
113168	This life, it... it stretches me to the limit.
113170	You know, there is nothing overly positive to say...
113177	Don't tell me you consider yourself truly satisfied with this.
113164	A little savoir vivre! Is that asking too much?
113172	Well, I am used to more amenities.
113169	Not the center of the world, but I don't demand that, either.
113171	There are no capital problems, if that is what you are alluding to.
113173	A little... boring here, don't you think?
113174	Ordinary.
113175	Living here has some merit. Some.
113176	Well, I haven't complained, have I?
113178	Presentable, at least.
113179	So, my investments did pay off.
113180	Am I smiling? Of course!
113181	It is a good life here, certainly.
113182	Well, your city leaves little to be desired.
113183	Just you wait. In a few years, this might be the place to be.
113184	Oh, I like investing in your city. I can see how it benefits everyone.
113185	I have apartments in many cities around the globe. But why leave?
113186	Decay of urban culture? I see nothing of that sort around here.
113187	I am hard to please, so you should feel proud.
113188	You're on the right path, I can say that much.
113189	I saw the greatest of all cities... well, actually I'm looking at it right now.
113190	I may be dressed for success, but you seem to be made for it!
113191	I know a rainmaker when I see one. When you're around, I always carry an umbrella.
113192	You have a magnificent view from up here. Of a magnificent city!
113193	This place looks so beautiful, it makes me feel plain.
113194	Happiness has a home. Look up my address!
113195	Work and life go hand in hand here. And aren't they a lovely couple!
113196	You are building the next corporate empire!
113197	I'm not modest. But when I see your accomplishments, I can't help feeling small.
113198	Just look at all this!
113199	Exemplary. You really care for your city's image.
113200	Ah, finally, a chance at entertainment.
113201	Bread and circuses... some things never go out of fashion.
113202	So, you're in charge here?
113203	Yes, very attractive properties, indeed.
113204	We haven't been introduced.
113205	It's a consumer age. You are what you buy. Good thing you provide us with such a wide range of choices.
113206	You ever hear of Global Trust? Big name back in the last century, and an even bigger company. But their Mars colonization attempts... disastrous.
113207	I heard there is some kind of turf war going on in the upper levels of Cassian Industries. We should keep an eye on that.
113208	As I support you in making your vision of a moon colony come true, I hope you will support me in making my vision of a luxury hotel on the Moon come true as well.
113209	We are lucky that the Arctic Custodians invented climate stabilizers. Fewer flooded areas, fewer people squashed together in one spot, fewer annoying neighbors...
105720	Free energy? For everyone? Hmmm... Well, this really does involve all of us... I'm going to set up a foundation.
115573	All my assets going to waste…
115574	Who dares?!
115575	I wish I could stop the cat from destroying my favorite chair...
115576	This year's wine vintage was quite a letdown.
115577	I should be a sponsor, I do love 21st century classics.
115578	This season's high collars are gorgeous!
115579	Let us always strive for perfection.
115580	I can finally lean back.
115612	Next, there'll be some horror show with rocks in it...
105591	Ecology, economy... When both remain in balance, then I'm doing my job.
113238	Woah, I wouldn't have pictured that!
113239	Wonderful!
113240	My day just got better.
113241	That went well.
113242	Oh, yeah...
113243	I like what I'm seeing.
113244	Awesome job!.
113245	Flawless.
113246	What more could you want?
113247	What a success!
113248	I'd call that a positive development.
113249	All bad things come to an end, I guess.
113250	Good to know that's a thing of the past.
113251	You know what you are doing.
113252	That was very considerate of you.
113253	You can't imagine just how grateful everyone is.
113254	I sure do thank you.
113255	You care. I appreciate that.
113256	You're doing the right thing.
113257	I must say, I admire you for that.
113258	You are as impressive as everyone says.
113259	You're keeping everything in balance.
113260	You are a remarkable person!
113261	Frustrating!
113262	It's sad!
113263	Well, that certainly didn't help.
113264	That's a recipe for disaster.
113265	How awful!
113266	Well, that's a problem.
113267	Less than ideal.
113268	Oh, sheesh!
113269	This is not happening.
113270	Things like this are so frustrating!
113271	How could you let that happen?
113272	I'm sure you meant... something... by that.
113273	And what do you plan to mess up next?
113274	Do you even understand what you've done?
113275	You don't want to hear my opinion.
113276	This is your own fault.
113277	Shouldn't there be some good news with the bad news?
113278	Oh yeah, thank you so very much!
113279	As long as it's done your way, right?
113280	That was totally irresponsible!
113281	You? What a nice surprise.
113282	It's cold out there, isn't it? Come in!
113283	Come on in.
113284	Oh hi. So, what brings you here today?
113285	Welcome. You want to come in?
113286	So, what do you say? Isn't it cozy here?
113287	Not many visitors here. Nice you came around, at least.
113288	It's no bother. You are always welcome.
113289	Oh, nice to meet you in person.
113290	You thought you'd just drop by? How nice of you!
113291	Nothing could keep me from it.
113292	Good idea. I'll do it.
113293	But of course.
113294	Makes sense. I'll get it done.
113295	Yeah.
113296	Thank you for your trust.
113297	You got it!
113298	I won't keep you waiting.
113299	Yes, I can do that for you.
113300	It's my job, right? Happy to help you.
113301	Been there. Done that. Won't do it again.
113302	I wish I could.
113303	I'm afraid not.
113304	And encourage this kind of approach? No way!
113305	Nah, not convinced.
113306	I'm sorry, but I have to let you down on this one.
113307	No, you'll have to do without me here.
113308	I can't just drop everything else.
113309	You're not angry that I have to refuse you, are you?
113310	You ask for the impossible.
113311	This is something we can't ignore.
113312	Everyone here is quite concerned about this.
113313	We need support of the highest level to get this done.
113314	Here. I figured you would know better just how to proceed with this.
113315	Sooner or later, this issue will cause us problems..
113316	There's still time to solve this before it gets worse!
113317	Thanks. That's a load off my mind.
113318	Who wouldn't be happy about that?
113319	Much obliged.
113320	You managed well. That's why you're the manager, I guess.
113321	The planet will thank you for it.
113322	You took heed of the problem. Thanks!
113323	You should feel good about yourself.
113324	Our future is in good hands with you.
113325	Are you a problem solver or a troublemaker?
113326	You know, this outcome could have been prevented.
113327	Why did you even bother?
113328	So far, so good, so unfinished.
113329	Seriously? You're going to lean back and do nothing?
113330	I can't change your mind, can I?
113331	I am sure, you have everything under control. You do, right?
113332	So?
113333	Hey, how was... oh, you're still on it, I see.
113334	Well, I guess no news is better than bad news.
113335	There's yet time.
113336	How long is it going to take? I'm just curious.
113337	The problem is still in place, I'm afraid.
113338	Sure, no worries. It takes a while to get a grip on things.
113339	Bingo.
113340	Seems to be what we're looking for.
113341	This is very important for us.
113342	Yes, we will need that one.
113343	Look what you've found.
113344	Oh, I would have missed that.
113345	That's it.
113346	Yes, that one.
113347	That's where you have to go.
113348	I'm sure they are expecting your arrival.
113349	You are to go there.
113350	Should be easy to reach.
113351	Yes, that's the place.
113352	Go there!
113353	So, start your engines.
113354	I hope you arrive in time.
113355	Who's there? Oh...
113356	Sheesh. Right in their line of sight.
113357	And now they know where we are.
113358	Warm... warmer...
113359	You'll be there soon.
113360	We are getting closer.
113361	Well hidden, but not well enough.
113362	Look what you found.
113363	That's it, no doubt.
113364	Wonderful. But that was only the tip of the iceberg.
113365	Very good. Let's hope the second part will be just as successful.
113366	Thanks. But this problem is more extensive than we first thought.
113367	You can still prevent any more harm from being done.
113368	The conflict is really heating up. You must step in.
113369	They are upsetting the balance of the whole region. Do something!
113370	Please, this violence is getting out of control.
113371	If this continues, the effects will be devastating!
113372	You sure poured some cold water on those firebrands!
113373	That could have ended up real ugly. But you were there.
113374	You prevented the worst from happening.
113375	You got out of that in the nick of time!
113376	You confronted them head-on. That was commendable if, in hindsight, not wise.
113377	Perhaps you were too careless of the danger.
113378	This place makes me shudder, and not from the cold.
113379	What do you want? Go eat snow!
113380	Frosty here, huh? What you expect from a place without a shred of human warmth?
113381	Wonder why we spend so much time outside? Just look at our homes!
113382	I thought living in the Arctic would be peaceful... but every day is a struggle here.
113383	It can't go on like this.
113384	I'm going to find greener pastures! Some that are actually green!
113385	Don't try to snow me. I know how bad things really are here.
113386	Sure, we're humble here. But you should at least provide the basics.
113387	You shouldn't be surprised if this area soon becomes unpopulated again.
113388	So this's the great white. Sure, it's white, but great, well...
113389	My job, hmm... well, you get through the day.
113392	The Custodians are constantly breathing down our necks. It's tiring.
113391	This place... not that bad, but that doesn't cut any ice.
113390	This place doesn't provide much variety, but hey...
113393	Considering we are in the middle of a snowy desert, it's a decent life.
113394	Eternal winter... well, you get used to it.
113395	It's true, mankind can survive anywhere. Even when it's hard.
113396	As long as it stays like this, we'll manage to get by.
113397	It could be worse.
113398	You don't leave us out in the cold... You know how I meant that.
113399	Things here are moving in the right direction.
113400	It's a beautiful day. And how couldn't it be in a place like this.
113401	Good food, a cozy home. Nothing to be desired.
113402	Who misses sandy beaches, when you can take the snowmobile to work?
113403	We are growing into a strong community here.
113404	It's cool here, and I'm not talking about the weather.
113405	I don't think there are any major problems right now.
113406	Are you fishing for compliments? You're sure to make a good haul here!
113407	It can be hard to comply with all of the Custodians' regulations. But I like the challenge.
113408	What's to say? As happy as a clam.
113409	We're opening the big Arctic treasure chest. Very carefully, of course.
113410	The clear air, the glistening snow... It's a little white paradise.
113411	You'd think all the cold and snow would make you sick... But I actually feel better than ever!
113412	A great feeling, working to benefit humanity as a whole. 'Cause that's what we do here, right?
113413	Who said anything about sacrifices? I'm not missing anything.
113414	My deepest thanks for all you've done for us!
113415	It is just so tranquil, so serene here... A true blessing for the soul.
113416	The city, the community, everything - it's just wonderful!
113417	What you've made of this place... Wow! Awe-inspiring!
113418	Thank you. We were in great need of this.
113419	Thanks. That's a lovely addition to the area.
113420	You know your town planning, no doubt about it.
113421	Thanks. Very livable, if you don't mind the cold.
113422	We'll keep an eye on everything here for you.
113423	I promise, we won't give the Custodians anything to complain about.
113424	I used to spend hours hiking the countryside alone, especially during winter. Well, if you're lucky you can turn your hobby into a career.
113425	Saayman International may fool the southerners, saying that they only use real fish. But honestly, it's clear they're stretching the fish with substitutes. Where would all the fish come from, if not from here?
113426	My suburban relatives always complain about annoying neighbors. Well, I had a polar bear sleeping in my front yard this week.
113427	So many people don't even know what snow looks like. Am I lucky, or what?
113428	You know, when I hear the sound of my feet touching new snow and I see the majestic glaciers rising on the horizon... I feel like I'm truly alive.
115532	Thanks for saving us! For a second I thought... I really thought...
115533	I can't feel my toes! Or my fingers! Please, just get me home, please!
115534	Did you see my sister? I swear, she was right behind me!
115535	It was a mistake to come out here.
115614	The snow doesn't make it less depressing here.
115616	It's not just the winters that cause some terrible moods.
115617	...and then, he slipped and fell right on his... Well.
115618	I need to remember to finally buy that daylight lamp.
115619	Finally, I get to eat fish again! I've missed it.
115620	Boss said to expect a bonus this month!
115621	The summers here are a dream!
115622	Yes! I got a private fishing license!
115691	We need to redo this module.
115692	Ooops, I spilled it...
115693	Careful with the waste!
115694	Okay, let's open another basin.
115695	The cooling systems are back online!
115696	One last push and we're done.
115697	One last sprint before the break, okay?
115700	Who's going to eat all this?!
115701	Why's it smell burnt?
115703	Good, this can take off now.
115707	I think we're lagging behind...
115708	Can I see the license for this?
115710	All right, we're done here.
115711	I'm digging the new menu!
115715	Sorry, can't talk about it.
105740	Fusion energy is a fascinating field. I thank you for the opportunity to investigate it.
105741	Many Thanks. This will simplify our calculations. I'll be in touch as soon as we have the first data.
105742	The research data the Global Union sent us seems to be very complex. We will need powerful computers to combine their data with ours.
105747	Yes, research laboratory Aurora 2 here! We made it! Cold Fusion in controlled energy cells! All that remains is large scale implementation!
115777	Negative. The systems don't respond... the stabilizer network is collapsing...
115790	Okay. We've completed the blueprints for the rocket launch pad plans and done a few tests. As far as we're concerned, you can start construction.
113580	Utterly fascinating!
113581	Brilliant, really.
113582	A textbook example.
113583	That was a stroke of genius!
113584	Phenomenal.
113585	I can't find any words for that!
113586	It's quite amazing in fact.
113587	What do you say...
113588	I can't stop being astonished!
113589	Super!
113590	Of course. Why didn't I think of that!
113591	Great. This has held us up long enough.
113592	Now, that is progress!
113594	Your calculation worked out really well.
113595	You are a phenomenon!
113596	You got the maximum out of it!
113597	It's due to you.
113598	I find no flaws in your performance.
113599	How you did this...simply astonishing!
113600	You are in my good books, so to speak.
113601	All credit is due to you!
113602	I could learn a lot from you.
113603	Your know-how is absolute.
113604	Impossible!
113605	How unreflecting!
113606	I refuse to believe this!
113607	That is a hard pill to swallow.
113608	[Sigh] I should sit down for a moment.
113609	Unthinkable!
113610	I should have known...
113611	That just can't be true!
113612	What foolishness!
113613	That gives me doubts about humanity!
113614	You should rethink your procedures.
113615	It's the thought that counts, you see?
113616	I'm not thinking poorly of you. But, still...
113617	I could have told you so much.
113618	Too bad your plan proved unsuccessful.
113619	It seems you haven't considered all the variables.
113620	Your reasoning has been pretty faulty.
113621	At least you yielded us new data on that.
113622	You have my sympathies.
113623	You know, sometimes it doesn't add up...
113624	Oh, hello.
113625	Come in. But please, don't touch anything.
113626	Hmm... Oh, sorry. Engrossed in thought.
113627	Ah, someone takes interest in my private research...
113628	Good. I wanted to show you my studies anyway.
113629	I hope you don't find it boring in here.
113630	Welcome to my home.
113631	Hmm, yes?
113632	Can I be of assistance?
113633	I'm in the middle of a test but spectators' welcome.
113634	Absolutely.
113635	I think that will be possible.
113636	I'll come up with something.
113637	I will.
113638	Straightaway!
113639	You can rely on my best efforts.
113640	You won't regret it.
113641	You'll have the results soon.
113642	Right, place your trust in science.
113644	I'll look after it for you.
113645	Out of question
113646	Um yes, but... No!
113647	Sorry, I'm a little out of sorts right now.
113648	Oh no, that would be too complicated.
113649	No, most certainly not.
113650	Sorry, I can't fulfill your expectations.
113651	I'm not quite finished with this thing here, you know?
113652	You see, this isn't the way these things are done.
113653	Do I look like a specialist to you?
113654	You can't talk me into that.
113655	This has been preying on my mind for some time...
113656	The plan is clear. Could you take over the implementation?
113657	Please, this isn't quite my field of specialty...
113658	May I pass this on to you?
113659	We need your professional expertise in this matter.
113660	Perhaps you have an idea how to solve this.
113661	The signs all pointed to failure, but that didn't stop you!
113662	You've proven things like that are feasible!
113663	Great thoughts breed great deeds. Your deeds.
113664	You certainly make it look simple.
113665	You really are very innovative!
113666	The best method imaginable!
113667	An excellent result, no doubt about it.
113668	You can't be praised enough!
113669	You acted to the best of your knowledge.
113670	Well, now we can be certain that's not the way to do it.
113671	Trial and error. You'll do better next time.
113672	I see, back to the drawing board.
113673	You have second thoughts about it, don't you ..
113674	So it wasn't an assurance after all...
113675	You want to inform me on the progress?
113676	I can't think about anything else. How far along are we?
113677	Can you give us a first estimate yet?
113678	So, have you already come up with a solution?
113679	We'll cover the theoretical side. The practical is up to you.
113680	Any developments yet?
113681	Enough thinking. It's time to take action.
113682	Hmm, the analysis doesn't indicate much progress...
113683	Indeed, that's it.
113684	I would classify it as one, yes.
113685	Yes, it's the one.
113686	Confirmed.
113687	You have the right one.
113688	We can rule out that it's something else.
113689	Looks like one, doesn't it?
113690	You would make a good researcher.
113691	Of course, where else?
113692	Please navigate there.
113693	The coordinates look correct.
113694	If our calculations are correct, it is here.
113695	Yes, it must be here.
113696	Good, we haven't lost the way.
113697	That's the location.
113698	Oh, you already know where it is.
113699	Weren't we careful enough?
113700	Of course, that was very subtle...
113701	I'd like to have one of their detectors.
113702	The measurements say, we are close.
113703	We're approaching it fast.
113704	Only a little further.
113705	Eureka! You found it!
113706	So there it is.
113707	A remarkable discovery.
113708	Thank you. But the problem has more than one facet.
113709	Sorry, I forgot to mention this problem in my initial request. You still got time?
113710	I hate to trouble you again, but... well, see for yourself...
113711	The increase in violence is alarming! Someone has to step in.
113712	I've analyzed the situation. It's very unstable.
113713	There's every indication, that this will escalate. Please intervene.
113714	I'm aware the risk is high... But they must be stopped.
113715	That's mainly a matter of force, not of brains.
113716	You are a brilliant strategist.
113717	They'll think twice before they challenge you again!
113718	Thank you. If you hadn't stepped in, it would have been disastrous.
113719	I recalculated it. No way you could have won this.
113720	Attacking without a good plan... you see where that gets you.
113721	[Sigh] We should promote our defense research.
113724	Science is essential to progress. But it seems we haven't realized that here yet.
113725	What's going on here! I can't even think straight!
113726	Our city planners are mistaking insanity for genius.
113727	In. Out. In! Out! Won't you let me work in peace?
113729	Perhaps the time isn't ripe for big ideas, at least not here...
113730	The way we're treated here is against all common sense.
113731	I bet other companies will appreciate my abilities more.
113732	Cold hands, warm heart, huh? Around here it's rather: Cold hands, cold shoulder.
113723	A multi-national corporation, but no means left for scientific research... something is wrong.
113728	I should've stayed at university.
113738	Why not improve this settlement a little. Just a thought.
113741	You want our research to pay off? Give us something to work with.
113742	I don't want to badmouth anything.
113740	I don't want to sound like a smartass, but we are underperforming here.
113733	Hmm, most decisions here at least make some sense.
113734	It's cerebral, but it's work nonetheless.
113735	Our settlement is... nothing of note.
113736	Studies are going well. But I don't live for my job alone.
113739	As long as I can carry out my research, I'm okay.
113737	It's the arctic. How comfy can it be?
113743	Our research is proceeding well. We are motivated.
113744	No grounds for complaint whatsoever.
113745	I'm working on an important international research project. Of course I'm fine.
113746	Thank you. Our concerns never go unheeded here.
113747	The cold? I enjoy spending most of my time in my lab, so I hardly notice.
113748	We're at the end of the world and you still provide us all those comforts.
113749	It's my job to question things, but this place is undoubtedly great.
113750	Hmm, re-upping my contract for a few years. I rather like the idea.
113751	Every day here provides a new chance to excel oneself.
113752	At first, I was skeptical, but seeing all this dissipated my doubts.
113753	You are constantly giving us fresh impetus.
113754	We're making one breakthrough after another here!
113755	This space program will redefine life on Earth! And I'm part of it!
113756	You are thinking outside the box! That's what makes you successful!
113757	And I just thought of you, too. Well, great minds think alike!
113758	They should write a research paper on you, as unbelievable as you are!
113759	Happiness is no exact science. But you seem to know its laws well.
113760	Sometimes I feel we are not grateful enough.
113761	I'll dedicate my next big discovery to you.
113762	Thought leader, now there's a term that suits you!
113763	Finally, our ideas are safe!
113764	Right! You have to protect your intellectual capital.
113765	So much for industrial espionage. Thanks!
113766	An interesting place, indeed.
113767	Someone called for scientists?
113768	We'll find the answers for you.
113769	I thought the Arctic Custodians were just greens on snowshoes. But the Climate Stabilizers... I've never seen such well thought out technology.
113770	It's the 23rd century and, if it wasn't for the lack of energy, we would be far more advanced than we are now. I'm glad someone is looking into that.
113771	Did you know that Cassian Industries has the biggest research department of all the Big Five? So many people, just to invent new drill heads? There must be something else...
113772	I don't think humanity will ever have all the answers to all the questions. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't seek them.
113773	Running this polar research station isn't rocket science. Let's hope I can change departments at some point.
114896	That Jorgensen fellow promised me fascinating climate phenomena. What do I get? A broken Climate Stabilizer.
114897	Jorgensen? Paid me an outrageous sum. Otherwise I wouldn't have shown up.
114898	I hope we're done with this soon. Don't want to be seen helping Jorgensen.
115623	I'm not being paid enough for this.
115624	Even the equipment here is ancient!
115625	Now, where'd I put my notes...
115626	Ugh, they keep traipsing in slush.
115627	This coffee really helps perk me up!
115628	Looking back, taking this job was a good idea.
115629	No better place for vital research than here.
115630	The peace and quiet are fantastic.
115698	Wow, the deposit is a lot more pure than we thought.
115699	I really need to eat more healthily...
115702	We'll need better conductors.
115705	Is everything accounted for?
115709	You can unload over there.
115712	Not mystery soup! Not again...
115713	Did I lock the door... ?
105721	Roger. You're coming in loud and clear. We can begin digging here on the Moon.
113774	Good!
113775	First-rate job!
113776	This is hot stuff!
113777	Nice one!
113778	Right on!
113779	Wicked!
113780	That's just about the limit!
113781	Oh, that was great!
113782	That's crackerjack!
113783	That worked a treat, for sure.
113784	Must say, I'm over the Moon 'bout that.
113785	Bless our lucky stars!
113786	The worst's over!
113787	You're tearin' it up at the whole leadership thing.
113788	You've done your job!
113789	Good for you!
113790	You sure hit the ground runnin'!
113791	You're onto it!
113792	Keep it up!
113793	You're really somethin'!
113794	You've got things sorted out!
113795	You're second to none, no question!
113796	Talkin' straight, you are the bomb!
113797	That's life.
113798	Talk about bad luck.
113799	[Sigh] So much for that...
113800	That's a nasty surprise!
113801	That's one sloppy piece of work.
113802	Come off it!
113803	Bad luck!
113804	That's gotten out of hand!
113805	That's messed up!
113806	People don't do that.
113807	A fine mess you've made of it!
113808	You always work like that?
113809	Guess you can't be blamed, huh?
113810	Won't lie, you made a mess of that.
113811	You're not particularly lucky, are you?
113812	Awww, come on!
113813	You took on too much, huh?
113814	Don't say that was your best!
113815	Ploughin' the sands, know what I'm sayin'?
113816	You must be jokin'!
113817	Readin' you loud and clear.
113818	I'd show you around, but there's not much to show.
113819	Hi.
113820	Hey, got a job for me?
113821	You didn't come all this way just to see me, huh?
113822	What's doing?
113823	Whoa, look who's here.
113824	Come in, take a deep breath!
113825	Well, now, here's some good company!
113826	Air lock's open.
113827	It's as good as done.
113828	Okay.
113829	No sweat.
113830	Gotcha.
113831	No prob.
113832	You name it!
113833	You can count on it!
113834	Lemme give you a hand.
113835	You won't be sorry.
113836	You bet!
113837	Nope.
113838	Whoa, that's outta my league!
113839	Won't get it done today.
113840	Already workin' my socks off here.
113841	No way.
113842	Have to disappoint you on that, sorry.
113843	Hey, I'm just human, you know.
113844	You asked the wrong guy.
113845	Can't help you here.
113846	Sorry, have to turn you down.
113847	This one won't sort itself out.
113848	No idea what to do about it. Have you?
113849	Hope it ain't rude to ask you directly.
113850	Looks like something big to me.
113851	I'd rather leave that to the decision maker.
113852	We've done all we can. Time to pass it on.
113853	It's a wrap!
113854	You're the top dog, that's for sure!
113855	Thanks a bunch!
113856	Great! That's that!
113857	Problem? Not for you!
113858	That's the way the cookie crumbles!
113859	You got a good grip on things here, I tell ya!
113860	I owe you one!
113861	Well that was good for nothing...
113862	Now we're worse off than ever!
113863	That kinda thing just ruins your day, huh?
113864	It's only the moonies, I get it!
113865	You feel good, leavin' your stuff half-finished?
113866	And now you tell me!
113867	I sure you're knocking yourself out on that.
113868	I'm counting on you.
113869	Thanks in advance.
113870	So, how's it going?
113871	You know the drill, don't ya?
113872	Get anything done yet? Just asking.
113873	Good to know things are movin'.
113874	Not something you can just do on the fly, I get it.
113875	You got it!
113876	Uh-uh, that's it.
113877	Go get it.
113878	Confirmed
113879	You're pointin' right at it.
113880	Not much else here to confuse it with, huh?
113881	Looks the right one to me.
113882	It's a striking thing, isn't it?
113883	There you go!
113884	Well, let's go then.
113885	Shall we?
113886	Have a pleasant trip.
113887	Get moving
113888	It won't come to you.
113889	You shouldn't have trouble reachin' it.
113890	Don't get lost.
113891	Damn, we're busted.
113892	I didn't see them comin'...
113893	They've spotted us.
113894	It's right ahead!
113895	Not much longer…
113896	I think I can already see it...
113897	You dug something up there.
113898	No keeping things hidden from you, huh?
113899	Wouldn't have found that without you.
113900	Not I'm not thankful, but that only revealed another problem.
113901	Thanks! Can I trouble you with something else?
113902	You didn't let us down on that and you won't let us down on this either.
113903	I guess you have to deal with them the hard way.
113904	Our work's dangerous enough. I'd rather not have a war at my doorstep as well.
113905	You ain't payin' us a danger bonus, so you better get rid of the danger.
113906	They're shootin' at people. You ain't gonna allow that, are ya?
113907	People are gonna die if you don't step in!
113908	I'll shed no tears for those terrorists!
113909	You sure gave them what for!
113910	Thanks. Now we can feel safe again.
113911	Just rushin' in... ain't quite the right tactic, is it?
113912	Time to pick up the pieces...
113913	That made my blood run cold.
113914	If crap was snow, then this colony was hit by an avalanche.
113915	My back hurts, my head aches, my lungs... ah, no use...
113917	I was prepared to live in a vacuum. But this place really has nothin' to offer.
113918	Take a look around? Would you wanna live here?
113919	How life is? Ask me how I manage to survive here?
113920	Sorry, I'm not that talkative. I have to save my air supply.
113921	That's pure exploitation, you know that.
113923	I'll wait for the next shuttle and then I'm outta here.
113922	I miss Earth.
113924	The job ad looked more promising!
113928	Can't say I'm overly motivated.
113930	My days here are pretty gray, know what I mean?
113934	If it wasn't for the good money...
113916	I shoulda known this Second Wave thing looked too good to be true.
113925	Roll with the situation, that's what they say.
113926	New place, same work. It's like anywhere else here.
113927	Works for me. Mostly.
113929	Come in. You're the one who pays for my oxy, after all.
113933	We all pull together here.
113935	Nothing to write home about.
113936	It's not cramped, it's cozy.
113937	I'm on easy street.
113938	When I think of fair work conditions. I think of this place.
113939	You have a good thing going on here!
113940	Signing on with the L.L.P. was a good decision.
113941	Can only speak for myself, but I'm pretty happy here.
113942	For a grey desert, this place is really quite homey.
113943	Work ain't so hard, when you have a nice home waiting for you.
113944	It's the simple life. I like that.
113945	The best thing's the sense of community, really.
113946	I'm livin' the dream!
113947	This was a piece of gray rock once. Look what you made of it!
113948	Two words... Zero gravity!
113949	Why do we need Earth? It's perfect here.
113950	This is final frontier!
113951	Course I'm good!
113952	Fly me to the Moon. Anytime!
113953	This place... just rocks. Get it?
113954	I could jump for joy, but I'm not one for heights!
113955	It's not just some crater. It's my home! And I love it!
113956	That alone makes me feel better.
113957	Regular checkups, that's what we need.
113958	Finally, I can have the doc take a look at that rash.
113959	Ready for the diggin'.
113960	One small step for me... um, you know the rest.
113961	Time to blow up some dust!
113962	The Big Five must be kickin' themselves that you stepped on the Moon before them.
113963	I'm sure, we're more efficient than the LEC folks. I mean, have you seen their mines... I wouldn't want to work there.
113964	Just like the old west here. Besides people shootin' each other and all that.
113965	I'm gettin' tired of all the moon cliches and all, you know? If you haven't lived here, you'll never understand what makes us tick.
113966	That Orbital Watch thing... I don't understand what the point is. Ain't there enough space here for everyone to live together? If they don't like us, they can have the dark side all for themselves.
115253	Oh thank you. Drake's men, they... they beat me up, spit on me, insulted me and all the other things you do to traitors.
115254	Thank you for taking us into your refugee camp! I sure it's cramped enough as it is…
115255	Thank you... thank you.
115714	And I can't even have a pet here!
115718	The overtime is killing my family time!
115719	I can't believe those Orbital Watch bastards...
115720	Landscape gets pretty boring after a while.
115721	Nothing like a party on the star deck!
115722	Can't wait to see their faces again!
115723	Oh man, I got a letter from home!
115724	A family on earth, and a family on the moon. Perfect.
115734	Keep away from the tank!
115735	This is vital work, so concentrate.
115737	Can't I test the new zero-g room?
115739	Can't even smoke here anywhere.
115740	Where'd I put that new drill head?
115741	Keep the water filters clean.
115744	Solar power sure is valuable.
115749	Lucky the airtight hull wasn't breached.
115751	I should restock our vitamin supplements.
115753	C'mon, just one letter...
115755	We'll need more shuttles soon!
115757	Don't worry about small impacts.
115761	Any volunteers for outside?
115762	Lookin' good!
105744	Security level Code Beta! Surveillance drones to positions! If they wanna sabotage our fusion reactors, they'll have to get past them first.
105745	Bad news! Our systems are showing enemy movement along the borders!
115860	Quick, boot up the energy shields!
115876	At first we mistook it for another meteorite. And now we've taken a closer look, we're even more confused. The satellite doesn't belong to the LEC, the Orbital Watch or any of the Big Five. I've never seen that logo before.
113980	That turned out well.
113981	I rate this A 1.
113982	That's a success of the first grade.
113983	A satisfying result.
113984	That's perfect.
113985	Well done.
113986	Outstanding!
113987	Great job!
113988	Not bad.
113989	Nicely done!
113990	That's Better.
113991	I'm glad you fixed that.
113992	One less thing in our way.
113993	You carried it out to perfection.
113994	You came, you saw, you succeeded.
113995	A great job you did there!
113996	Home and dry. Well done.
113997	You're a true leader!
113998	Ha, you saved the day!
113999	I like your style!
114000	Congratulations on your success.
114001	Hey, Good result!
114002	You should be commended for that.
114003	That went ugly.
114004	Clearly a mess.
114005	It couldn't be helped.
114006	That went downhill.
114007	That was bad.
114008	Poorly executed.
114009	That really missed the mark.
114010	Dang it, that sucks.
114011	Move along, nothing to see here.
114012	That's a mess.
114013	Look, nobody's perfect.
114014	That'll come to haunt you.
114015	That'll get you nowhere.
114016	You see, no plan survives first contact.
114017	Didn't you see it coming?
114018	You seem to be off your game.
114019	Sometimes, it's just beyond you.
114020	You just can't control situations like that.
114021	There are times when you have to admit defeat
114022	Your strategy was flawed, I'm afraid.
114023	Hey, what's up?
114024	Is it urgent?
114025	Yes?
114026	Nothing to report here.
114027	You got orders for me?
114028	No, I don't mind visitors.
114029	Oh, are you doing an on-site inspection?
114030	How can I help you?
114031	At your service!
114032	Hi, what can I do for you?
114033	The honor's mine.
114034	Affirmative!
114035	Roger.
114036	Copy that.
114037	Understood.
114038	I'll make you proud!
114039	I hear you.
114040	Don't worry! I'm on it.
114041	You're giving the orders.
114042	I'll do this instantly for you.
114043	Not on my watch.
114044	No.
114045	I can't do that.
114046	Definitely not.
114047	Not now.
114048	We aren't equipped for something like that.
114049	We can't risk that.
114050	Don't mistake this for insubordination. But I have to say no.
114051	I was given other duties, so I can't you see.
114052	Sorry, you got me at the wrong time.
114053	We still got time.
114054	This situation needs help.
114055	It's not a routine problem. I hope you have a good plan.
114056	Everything's ready. You can take over from here.
114057	How do we proceed?
114058	We have a code red here. Something has to be done!
114059	You got it in under the wire.
114060	Mission accomplished!
114061	That's the spirit!
114062	I'm happy you're the one calling the shots here.
114063	Man, you really are someone to rely on.
114064	There's no situation you can't handle, right?
114065	All done. You're outstanding!
114066	You do what has to be done. And you do it well.
114067	Don't want to think about consequences!
114068	I'm underwhelmed!
114069	At least you can say the worst is over. I think.
114070	But... it's our duty.
114071	I see, you're actually deserting us...
114072	That only postpones the problem...
114073	Status report?
114074	The mission details?
114075	Are there results already?
114076	I have nothing to report. What about you?
114077	Rapid execution, that's the key.
114078	The problem presists
114079	Here's the key parameters.
114080	You don't need reinforcements, right?
114081	You have it in your sights.
114082	That's of strategic importance.
114083	This is what we're looking for.
114084	Target object located.
114085	Found it.
114086	Ready for takeover.
114087	It's nonhazardous. Just take it.
114088	That's part of the objective.
114089	Lead the way.
114090	Target location confirmed.
114091	Take care.
114092	Right ahead.
114093	Come on!
114094	Make your move.
114095	Destination in sight.
114096	Yeah, proceed to that location.
114097	[Sigh] Stealth operation failed.
114098	They spotted us.
114099	We're on their radar
114100	Getting closer.
114101	We're almost within reach.
114102	You're going in the right direction.
114103	You found it.
114104	It's located. Finally.
114105	So, this is the one then?
114106	Thanks. But there's another problem hanging over our heads right now.
114107	Great outcome. But you'll have to do this too, if you wanna remain like this.
114108	The danger's not fully banned yet. This calls for a follow-up mission.
114109	Awaiting orders. Forces ready to respond to provocation.
114110	Enemy activity sighted. Your orders?
114111	Prepare yourself, this is a war zone.
114112	We should increase security here. Preferably by eliminating the danger.
114113	The best defense is a good offense. Let's see if that's really true.
114114	You are one of the great strategists of our time.
114115	With you, victory is practically certain.
114116	You sure don't pull any punches.
114117	That's not how you win a war.
114118	At least go down fighting.
114119	We should try another tack next time.
114120	Ever thought of making this a prison planet. I mean, it already feels like one.
114121	You expect me to give my best, while providing me the worst quarters imaginable?
114124	I think I'll apply for a transfer soon. Back to Earth.
114125	I know war zones that are more homelike.
114126	The safety policies here... just reckless.
114127	It angers me to see all the injustice here.
114128	If you wanted to freeze me out, then congratulations.
114129	This place will sink into chaos. Mark my words.
114130	Nothing out of the ordinary here. Sadly.
114134	Sometimes I think there must be more to life than this.
114135	We're fulfilling our quota. But should that really be all it's about?
114122	I don't know where to start...
114123	Signing that contract... I should have thought it through.
114131	Just the daily routine. I don't want to bore you.
114132	It's a dangerous life here, but honestly, where isn't?
114133	I guess the situation here is under control.
114136	I'm as happy as one can expect, living on a gigantic gray rock.
114137	Don't expect any complaints from my side.
114138	This vast emptiness really grows on you.
114139	I've been worse off.
114140	Everything is in good shape here.
114141	I'm glad to be here.
114142	Sometimes it's a tough ride. But then again, it's a big adventure, too.
114143	This place has good prospects, if you ask me.
114144	Whatever it is, we can deal with it.
114145	Been awhile since I heard an alarm here.
114146	Everything's safe, orderly... very nice.
114147	I wouldn't have expected that life on the Moon to be so... convenient.
114148	It's a life worth living!
114149	Hard work brings us together. I like that.
114150	You are the conqueror of space!
114151	The view alone! Indescribable!
114152	I'm living at the forefront of the future. What's not to envy?
114153	Other people pay good money to see this. And I have it all for free.
114154	Nothing and no one could make me leave.
114155	If someone bothers you, you can just mute him on your headset. Not like that happens a lot, though.
114156	It's a great honor to work for you.
114157	Volunteering for this was the best decision I ever made.
114158	I'm living here. I repeat that a lot, because otherwise I wouldn't believe it myself.
114159	Is this great, or is this great?
114160	Exactly, safety first.
114161	Good to see your security policy doesn't end with information evenings.
114162	How would our colony work without them, right?
114163	Reporting for duty.
114164	I'll keep everything in order!
114165	Can't wait to do my part!
114166	At work, I mostly talk in abbreviations... I don't want to be the one responsible for a shuttle crash or something, just because my commands took too long.
114167	Have you ever heard of Global Trust? It was a big company last century... until they settled for space. Makes me shudder, thinking of the poor folks they left for dead on Mars.
114168	Giant steps, that's what you take, walkin' on the Moon.
114169	Thought-out work safety guidelines, that's the essential thing. Just think what happened at the Bainbridge Crater. I say that's the real reason they tried to replace the LEC via the lunar program.
114170	You know, when I first watched the earthrise on the colony shuttle trip, I knew I belonged here.
115726	They're doing what now?
115727	It feels more like a coffin than a home.
115728	I don't miss Earth all that much.
115729	There's just not much to do around here...
115730	The moon gravity is great for my back.
115731	I never thought I'd grow this attached to the place.
115732	I'm never going back to Earth!
115733	Sports in zero gravity, awesome!
115738	These are not the circuits you're looking for.
115742	And a sunlight refractor over there...
115743	Careful not to overload the systems.
115745	Let's take a test walk on the moon!
115746	Okay, airtank is sealed. Done!
115750	Sure thing, I can fix this.
115752	You know what the speed limit is on the moon son? do you?
115754	Stand back, I'm closing the hatch!
115756	Damn, the Watch took out a transporter...
115758	Wait a sec, the lock is opening.
115759	Can I see your dosimeter?
115760	So, about dinner...
116088	We are under attack!
116089	Battlestations! They're attacking!
116090	Here they come!
116091	Enemy detected! All hands engage!

116339	On our way!
116268	Here comes a depression. So better resurrect your anoraks, folks. Some chilly winds blowing in from the Arctic Circle. Climate stabilizers, what would you do without them...
116269	Thanks, Lloyd. For those who have just tuned in, I'm Lauren Beringer and this is "Global Warning" filling you in on what moves the world in 2205.
116270	However, we're reaching out into orbit today. Live from the Moon we're linked to Virgil Drake, Executive Overseer of Mining for the Lunar Excavation Corp. Good morning, Mr. Drake.
116271	Mr. Drake, as a member of the LEC, you live on the Moon 24/7. How do you view the relationship between Earth and the Moon a good century after the establishment of the first moon colony?
116272	Hard words, coming from a member of a government-owned organization...
116273	Mr. Drake, pardon me, but isn't it always easy to blame the government? The Global Union has to balance manifold interests. Take the Arctic Custodians. Their Climate Stabilizers preserve what's left of the polar regions...
116274	Actually, the Global Union is now starting the Lunar Licensing Program, awarding Moon parcels to private corporations.
116275	Indeed, the Big Five are at forefront of the Lunar Licensing Program. But don't you fear the LEC will fade into insignificance with competition like that?
116276	Our time is up. Thank you for the interview, Mr. Drake.
116277	Yes, the Lunar Licensing Program is currently the hottest topic around. We now go to our correspondent at Global Union headquarters.
119936	Welcome to your Ark. My name is E.V.E., and I am an artificial intelligence. My systems are designed to assist you. You can trust me implicitly. Always!
119937	Welcome to your Ark. My name is E.V.E., and I am an artificial intelligence. My systems are designed to assist you. You can trust me implicitly. Always!
119938	Welcome to your Ark. My name is E.V.E., and I am an artificial intelligence. My systems are designed to assist you. You can trust me implicitly. Always!
13000473	All objectives achieved. Congratulations.
13000474	Mission objectives achieved. I am... Feeling... Something… Pride perhaps?
13000475	All assignments completed. Efficiency: 100%. Congratulations!
13000476	All parameters correct.
13000477	Your course of action is correct.
13000478	You have anticipated my recommendation.
13000479	You are acting logically.
13000480	Your conduct is appropriate.
13000481	They are functioning error-free.
13000482	All systems online.
13000483	At your service.
13000484	Communication systems online.
13000485	How may I help you?
13000486	What can I do for you?
13000487	We are not compatible.
13000488	Outcome unacceptable.
13000489	Warning! Inadequate!
13000490	Registering critical standard deviation.
13000491	Your response is inappropriate.
13000492	Your conduct check failed. Error code 404.

109075	Cassian Industries
109076	Assistant to the Vice President
109077	Heavy Industry
109261	As the foremost provider of natural resources and heavy industry products, Cassian Industries is one of the pillars of global commerce. Cassian is known for its uncompromising business policies. It led them on a path of success, but also of isolation. Today, Cassian Industries puts more funds into their own space program than any other megacorporation.
109078	Usoyev Inc.
109079	Consultant
109080	Biotech
109272	Usoyev Inc. takes pride in being a traditional venture, looking back on four generations of continued corporate success while showing no signs of old age. Yet this could change before long. The old chemical group's space program just can't seem to get off the ground and word has it that their presence on the Arctic's last oil rigs is more than questionable.
109081	Lei Sheng
109082	Head of Intelligence
109083	Energy
109273	Once one of the leading actors on the corporate stage, Lei Sheng has been ill-starred for quite some time. Certainly, the fall of Global Trust fifty years ago led to an energy supply vacuum that Lei Sheng knew how to fill. But the energy corporation has been resting too long on these past successes and now has trouble to keep the pace.
109084	Saayman International
109085	Officer for External Affairs
109087	Agriculture
109287	There is hardly a company out there that is held in higher esteem than Saayman International. From a small association of farming enterprises, Saayman grew into a food giant that now provides a considerable percentage of the global population with their daily bread. Saayman has become a world power in its own right and the corporation's ambitions are political, as well as economical.

10000118	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is leaving his treasure in good hands.
10000119	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] always keeps his side of the deal.
10000120	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] expresses his deep gratitude.
10000177	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] thanks you for taking care of the Fat Lady.
10000040	If you got your grabby hands on this log... I really must've bit the grass. Pay attention, I recorded this for your benefit! For this treasure hunt you're gonna need a treasure map. I hid it in that crevice just up north...
10000041	Hah, this log triggered so you found it! Or at least its tracker, that's how I know. You better got the map too, cause you need the numbers mumbo jumbo on it to find my stash.
10000042	Be grateful, I'm leaving you the fruits of multiple lifetimes of work. That's why the location's undocumented, don't want the nosey buggers finding it.
10000043	You know where to look, right? Underwater warehouses are for the ages, they said! Or maybe y'all are underwater yourselves now?
10000044	So how's the future? Still fighting them tsunamis and high tide? Not expecting an answer, just let an old man wax philosophical. But you better build something that lasts.
10000045	Underwater earthquakes are only getting worse. Had to abandon my own treasures. Not safe, they said! Well now at least there's you to take care of them.
10000046	...this thing recording? Right! You're back! Thought I had just one? Not when there are whole cities down there! So, you got something shiny, and I want my Lady safe.
10000047	You're listening to this log that means... I'm not around to take care of my ship. You ain't getting a peep on the second stash until I'm sure she's fine! Incentive, ya see?
10000048	Salt water can do something fierce to a nuclear generator, and it never was all that stable. But she's fine, isn't she? A year or three wouldn't harm her!
10000049	Alright, whatever you just did caused a power surge. How's that for clairvoyance? Just kidding. Alright, I'm convinced, the location-... is-... got it? ...
10000050	... Alright, I'm convinced, the location is south of here, got it? My ship's a vessel for the ages, whatever hiccups you've fixed, they're not gonna bring her down. You there yet?
10000051	The sea's been rumbling again, but they said not to worry. I bet they're causing this! Holing up at the bottom of the Ebashi trench like sardines in a tin is messing with their heads!
10000052	That's it, that's my treasure! Not much use to me anymore... I can't reach it, the hatches caved in. That'll happen to those Tech weirdos too, sooner or later.
10000054	I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me! Alright, I got one more. Didn't wanna give this one up, but you gotta do me one more favor in return.
10000055	This one's a bit tricky, so listen up. People these days have the attention span of ants. It's 2085 and we're still stuck on earth! If I was... Right, right, where was I? Ah, the storage.
10000056	Locks are the parts that rust first, so just in case, there's a failsafe. Nice of me to record it, right? It's split in three parts, so you don't flood the whole thing by accident.
10000057	Computer says you got them modules. Not sure about the power supply these days, but those Techs told me it'll last a good century! Don't trust them as far as I can throw'em, though.
10000058	See, all fine and dandy. There are some neat defense mechanisms, too. Be sure to get the module order right! I had to duck for cover a few times before...
10000059	Those defense subs scorched the hull a few times, too. But I always reset it in the nick of time. Oh the irony if my own security sank my ship one day!
10000060	Doors still locked? Well listen up. One day the Lady's gonna run outta fuel. And I want to keep her going till the sodding end of the world. So you refuel her... and I'll give you the key.
10000061	There you go, my haul is yours. It's not like I'll need it where I'm headed... or am now, I s'pose. But my Lady, she's gonna be around long after I'm gone.

7001819	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] advises you to install the newest module.
7000332	"Setting up a research division comes before anything else, though. We've got to be prepared for anything."
7000331	"Here's the catch: a virus has broken out of the vault. For a research team to match it, we're dependent on your supply network, your spaceport."
7000334	"Even though the marshes are the most biodiverse habitat here, we have no choice but to drain them. We can't work with the little space we have."
7000333	"Not just any staff will do. The research division needs experts to combat the virus."
7001456	"The team has extracted the first samples, but no trace of the virus so far. I want to run more tests, but we're understaffed."
7000335	"The moss sample is virus-free and surprisingly versatile. I've engineered an agriculture module with it, so go ahead and see for yourself how important our work is."
7000218	"We can't do anything with frozen seeds, but thawing them isn't so easy. A fixed temperature control can do that without risking a viral outbreak."
7000219	"Think of what we're building as a kind of climate stabilizer. I've got the blueprints of the real deal as reference and now we need the staff to realize them."
7000220	"For the temperature control to work, you'll need to clear its ventilation shafts. The Eden Initiative never imagined the volcano would bury them one day."
7000221	"Okay, so the old temperature modules are a complete loss. Time to replace them."
7000222	"And now comes the heavy-lifting on the shoulders of nature. This structure needs quite a lot of fuel to run."
7000223	"All clear. I'm just waiting for you to flip the lever now."
7000224	"As if closing off the sector would make the blown up reactor disappear. Now it is up to us to clear out the radioactive wreckage."
7000225	"The reactor didn't stand a chance against the volcano. Making it safer will start with a new cooling system."
7000226	"Alright, we've got all major wreckage parts and mapped out the rest. Now it's just a matter of shipping them off."
7000227	"With that out of the way our team can get to work on the reactor. They need to get there, though."
7000228	"Don't worry, we're just using the generator to get into the vault. And for that it needs quite a lot of input to start up."
7000229	"The sooner we finish up with the generator the faster we can get back to the virus. Switch it on, now."
7000232	"I've got news and it's not good: Sprawl Fever is back from extinction. Can you get me live samples? Infected musk oxen have been sighted at the fringes of the valley."
7000230	"Worst case just came true. Researchers just reported symptoms while taking water samples from the lakes. Recovering them is our top priority."
7000231	"The vaccine isn't ready yet and the patients' vitals are failing. Quick, get them something to boost their immune system."
7000233	"Our patients are stable and Howard has proposed a joint research endeavor. The Custodian labs can help us as soon as they get the seed samples."
7000234	"Whatever the Custodian virologists are doing, it's too slow. We've got to support them from here."
7000235	"Volcano erupted, damaged the reactor, reactor damaged the vault, vault exposed the infected seeds. And now here we are and need to seal the leaks."
7000236	"This still leaves us with mosquitoes, the primary disease-spreaders. Draining the marshes in the valley will decimate their numbers."
7000237	"Finally, I've got a vaccine at the ready. I'll have it distributed amongst the staff, but the animals in the wild need individual treatment."
7000238	"With our patients treated and disease vectors taken care of, we still have all those seed containers that need checking. Would you delegate a team?"
7000239	"The team has identified the infected seeds. Custodian regulations require us to scrub down the vault and I've got just the right antidote."

7001730	"The scenery might be breathtaking, but we've got far too few aircraft to pick up our field equipment!"

7000354	Arctic Custodians
7001085	There we go!
7001086	Good, I can work with this.
7001087	Nice.
7001088	That's what I'm talking about!
7001089	Just so!
7001095	Looks like this is actually going to work out!
7001096	One less worry.
7001097	Good, that's not going to bother us anymore.
7001098	Color me impressed.
7001099	The Custodians could stand to learn a thing or two from you.
7001100	I have to hand it to you, you know your craft.
7001108	I'm not cleaning that up.
7001109	What a mess.
7001110	Nope, not good enough.
7001111	Can't have it all.
7001112	Oh come on!
7001117	Tell me this isn't the end of it.
7001118	Put in a bit more backbone next time!
7001119	We can't all be perfect I guess.
7001126	So what's the news?
7001127	Don't mind the mess in here, it's organized chaos.
7001128	We're understaffed, so you're always a welcome sight.
7001129	You're not just going to stand around, are you?
7001130	Good news, bad news, I'm prepared either way.
7001136	Gotcha!
7001137	Yes, alright.
7001138	I got this.
7001146	No chance!
7001147	Absolutely not.
7001148	Nope, not an option right now.
7001162	This job isn't out of your skill range, is it?
7001163	You're one of the few I can trust to get this job done.
7001164	I'm swamped with work. Can you take this assignment?
7001168	Glad you took it seriously.
7001169	Perfect, now I can take it from here.
7001170	Great job! I wouldn't know why Howard has a problem with you.
7001171	Now that's what I call a job well done.
7001172	You're my best bet when it comes to getting stuff done!
7001176	Well, you tried.
7001177	One step forward, two steps back... Oh well.
7001179	Fine, I'll get it done one way or another.
7001180	Suit yourself.
7001182	The task isn't going anywhere, but it's still important.
7001183	We all have our cross to bear, and yours is that task I gave you.
7001184	I'd be taking care of it myself if I could.
7001206	That's taken care of... More work ahead!
7001207	That's good work, but we're not in the clear yet.
7001208	If we want to weather this storm, we need to stay focused.
7001587	I can see the light at the end! Just a little push now.
7001588	I hate to say this, but... one more thing.
7001280	The new batches are in the analyzer, I'm going for a smoke. And before you say anything - I know all about the Custodian's policy. Health this, nature that! I need a break.
7001281	My nephew is up there on the Moon and hasn't called in weeks. I'm afraid that the Orbital Watch is coming after him... or worse, that he's buying their propaganda. Damn, what has that idiot gotten himself into?
7001282	Howard really does love his job. You could've fooled me though - he's always so sour about everything. Then again, maybe that's his natural face.
7001283	Jorgenson is the odd one out among the Custodians. Glad he's the one manning the trading around here, makes the area a bit livelier. I met his boyfriend too, they make a cute couple.
7001284	The reclusive Arctic Custodian lifestyle just isn't for me. I think they misinterpreted the Eco's mission statement and took the austerity a bit too personally.
7001288	This vault was built following the Ebashi Trench catastrophe and its tsunamis. Things were looking pretty grim back then and people became obsessed with leaving legacies that would last.
7001289	While we Custodians are technically the Eden Initiative's successors, most of their records regarding the vaults and their contents were lost. Breaking into the vault will involve some risky trial and error.
7001589	Howard is keen on getting corporations out of the arctic. He doesn't care much what happens to the tundra plains as long as his miles of pristine snow are safe.
7001299	Alright, I know how to take care of the ice. I'm just waiting for you.
7001300	Preparations complete! I can't start working on the generator without you, though.
7001301	I've got news on the virus. You'd better get over here.
7001626	We're both eager to get into the seed vault, but first we'll need local researchers to deal with anything we find here.
7001627	Perfect. And don't worry, the nearby volcano isn't going to erupt and bury your settlement. I'm monitoring it.
7001628	But there's an actual reason to worry: we're dealing with a virus. Quarantining the sector is not an option, as we rely on outside food supplies. But with your spaceport as gateway we're on the safe side.
7001629	Good, we'll need your full corporate network if I'm right. If this is an ancient pathogen and reaches a major population center, we're in trouble.
7001630	We'll need a larger research division, but settle on that marsh and you'll be dug out in a few centuries. So first we'll have to pump it dry.
7001637	Howard is not going to like these pumps, but what's he going to do besides waggle his finger? Colonizing the tundra was his idea, after all.
7001638	The other Custodians are keen to redirect settlers over to my jurisdiction. But not on my watch, I'm only authorizing specialists. We'll need a team of experts to combat the virus.
7001639	The staff will be fine, so far the symptoms have only been observed in animals. But I'm keeping an eye on it, it's nothing that I've ever seen before.
7001640	The team was able to extract the first samples from the vault, but so far no luck in finding the virus or proving my theory. I need fresh pairs of eyes running tests on this.
7001641	The seeds the new team was able to recover show no traces of the virus. However, there's good news for you.
7001642	We've sampled a sprawling, but non-native moss species and I'm fairly certain it came from the vault. To strengthen our relationship, I've engineered a module that exploits the moss's exponential growth. Try it out!
7001643	Neat, isn't it? Just think what we'll be able to do when we secure the entire vault.
7001662	The seed vault is our goal, but we can't go waltzing in. If we repair the temperature control, we'll thaw the vault without risking the virus getting out of control.
7001663	Installing a heater for a freezer sounds paradoxical, but remember the 21st century was the era of climate change and the 22nd of climate correction. Think of this as some kind of stabilizer.
7001664	I managed to get the classified climate stabilizer blueprints. We're not copying them of course, but with enough staff we can give the old tech an overhaul.
7001666	Oh, did I say the volcano is safe? Hah, well, it is now. The Eden Initiative thought nothing would happen, but it erupted not long afterwards and buried the ventilation shafts. We'll need to clear them.
7001674	I just came back from checking on the old temperature modules and... No chance, completely fried. Global warming and climate correction took their toll. We'll need new ones.
7001676	Fuelling this machinery is anything but eco-friendl; after all we need enough power to thaw an ice layer. It's unavoidable, so let's do this right.
7001677	Good, all set to boot up!
7001678	Let's hope this goes smoothly, for all our sakes. I had the team clear out so flip the lever once you're ready.
7001679	It worked, the vault climate is stable! Wait till we fix the nuclear reactor, we'll need the temperature control for that.
7001680	When the reactor blew up my bosses just slapped a 'Do Not Enter' sign on the sector and now most of the wreckage is still lying around. We've really got our work cut out for us.
7001681	Good start. The vault and the virus will have to wait until we've taken care of this health hazard.
7001682	The reactor was built to last, but certainly not to withstand a volcanic eruption. It ruptured the cooling system and that's the first part we'll have to reconstruct.
7001683	Cleaning out all this radioactive waste is no small logistical feat, but it has to be done. No wonder closing off the sector was the easier solution.
7001684	The wreckage is mostly cleared and the cooling systems are good to go. We can get the team started on the generator itself now, just give them a lift first.
7001685	The generator is necessary to open the vault doors without destroying them. And we might have to close them again. Keep the power coming, the generator needs a push to start up.
7001687	Alright, we've got green light, we're-- hold on, I'm getting an emergency call. ... Okay, hit the activation button, we've got no time to lose. Our team just found a mutated virus strain.
7001775	Good, the nuclear reactor is stable and the doors are operational! The team is collecting samples as we speak.
7001689	Just as we suspected: It's Sprawl Fever, a formerly extinct disease with a high mortality rate that causes malignant growths. I'll need more live samples to study the mutations.
7001691	Damn. Field researchers just reported the onset of symptoms. Hurry up, you need to relocate them asap!
7001693	I'm in the middle of engineering a vaccine, but in the meantime we need medication to boost our patients' immune systems. The Arctic Custodian main branch has been informed.
7001776	You've saved many lives. And I bring good news, too!
7001701	Howard's on our side. He suggested we ship out the seeds to a better-equipped Custodian lab. Analyzing the virus is a lot harder than I thought.
7001703	My colleagues are having headaches over the virus strains, we'll need to back them up locally! Apparently one of the seed containers isn't just carrying what it says on the label.
7001704	Results are in. The irregularity they found used to be a pasta dish. I can't believe all this happened because someone dropped their lunch...
7001705	I can guess what happened. The volcano damaged the vault leaving the infected seeds exposed and voila, germination! Time to weld those leaks shut.
7001706	With the root cause of infections stamped out, we still have the mosquitoes. They're carriers of the disease and will continue to spread it until we dry out their marshes.
7001708	Excellent news! My experimental vaccine is showing promise, I'll have it deployed amongst the staff right away. The animals will have to be treated individually in the wild, however.
7001709	New infections are a risk as long as the virus is still affecting who knows how many seed containers. We'll have to expand our team to catalog them all.
7001710	The Custodians are waiting for us to clean out the vault and I've finally got something ready. Sort of a spray-on antidote and disinfectant in one. It should work.
7001777	And Howard owes you too, even though he'd never admit it.
7001716	This germinating seed is unbelievable! See how its cold-resistant properties make reactions possible at these temperatures?
7001717	So what's the new module doing for your arctic facilities? Don't tell me you haven't even installed it yet!
7001718	There was one good thing to come out of this nuclear disaster, gamma-ray absorbing organisms!
7001719	You've still got to shield your new module from meteorites, but it'll boost your production on the moon all on its own. Well, if you feed it enough.
7001720	See? This last module is the most effective! The vault is like the library of Alexandria, except we saved it.
7001721	And here I thought you were only helping me out to get your hands on the module? Maybe I was wrong about you.
7001624	My Arctic Custodian colleagues have been talking about you. If half of what they're saying is true you'll be very interested in what I've come across.
7001305	Pleased to meet you! I'm Esther Nylund, Arctic Custodian chief biologist and in charge of the Seed Vaults here. Extinct species isn't the only thing they preserved. Help me out and you'll get exclusive access.
7001623	Sorry, no entry for laypersons. You need to show some scientific background or my hands are tied.
7001306	Glad you could make it. This is a beautiful place, but isolated.
7001307	That might be the reason the Eden Initiative chose this place. Two centuries ago, they built a Seed Vault here to preserve now extinct species. That's what we're after.
7001308	However, the vault hasn't been maintained properly and has leaks. It's brought something else with it from the past, something dangerous.
7001312	I'm a scientist, not a miracle worker!
7001315	I'm not a physicist myself, but that's what our team is for. Still, we're not ready.
7001350	I'm working round the clock, but glaring at the centrifuge won't make it spin any faster, believe me.
7001318	Thanks. I mean it.
7001711	But before we can get into the vault proper we've got to fix the blown temperature control. I'll get the plans ready, stay tuned.
7001712	I'll get the operation ready. In the meantime I've got good news: the team engineered a cold-resistant module using their new findings!
7001713	Now it's my turn. I'll let you know once I have the first results on those mutated strains. For now you can test the new modules, we've modified them for lunar operation.
7001714	We've already got results. You can now install new modules that are especially effective in moderate climates.
7001715	We've defeated the virus, once and for all! The team is archiving centuries of samples. Looks like the Eden Initiative's endeavor wasn't for nothing!
7001578	That's going to be a cakewalk, right?
7001579	I'm sure you'll manage just fine.
7001580	Make sure to be thorough.
7001581	Thanks!
7001582	Much appreciated!
7001583	Ta!
7001584	Well then, let's get to work!
7001585	No time to waste, let's get right to it.
7001586	I'll leave you to do your thing, then.
7001590	We both do what we have to do, I get it.
7001591	Playing by the books in the arctic and not a single care out here?
7001592	And here I thought your energy production didn't rely on fossil fuels.
7001593	It took well over a hundred years to get the arctic back, but sure, burn away.
7001594	I'm already looking the other way. Now it seems I also need a pair of earmuffs.
7001595	If this is the price I have to pay to get this sector secured...
7001596	Back already from corporate meetings? I'm not complaining.
7001597	I told you before, without my clearance no one's--Oh! You're not Howard.
7001598	I've been holding the fort, now it's time for a change of the guards.
7001599	There you go.
7001600	Need anything else?
7001601	And I thought you'd had enough of that.
7001602	I'll check in the back for more later.
7001604	Seems useful.
7001605	Waste not, want not.
7001606	Oh, I've been meaning to stock up on that!
7001607	It's costly to ship anything out here, so thanks.
7001608	The swamp's been cleared of wildlife, so go ahead.
7001609	Navigating the marsh is tricky. It'll take a while to set up the pump.
7001610	Quite the expansion, eh?
7001611	You can get the drainage started now.
7001612	You'll need to turn the pumps on, too.
7001613	Don't keep the swamp waiting.
7001614	This will take a while, grab a chair.
7001615	All that water has to go somewhere!
7001616	The pumps are doing their thing.
7001617	Less marsh, more soil.
7001618	Finally. The pumps were a real eye-sore.
7001619	Well done, Moses.
7001741	Wading through mud is fun, but not that fun.
7001742	What's the hold-up?
7001743	You can afford this, right?
7001747	The marsh is as dry as a conversation with Howard. Time to dismantle the pump.
7001748	The ground won't get any drier.
7001749	No more danger of sinking!
7001761	See that? The symptoms are visible even to laypeople.
7001762	Don't get too close.
7001763	We're monitoring it. There's nothing more we can do right now.

13000004	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is happy to see the first elevator working.
13000005	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is planning the third elevator.
13000003	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] reminds you to not forget your own part in this.
13000219	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is appalled at your cowardly attack.
13000220	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] is thankful for your protection.
13000222	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] reminds you that you are far from uninvolved.
13000224	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] can't thank you enough.
13000006	"Look at this beauty! Early spaceport prototype, built and then dismantled by the Global Union. There should still be some usable parts around here. We refurbish it and share the route!"
13000007	"There's a real mint to be made up there, if you know the right people. And with the right partner to provide the manpower, of course."
13000008	"Y'know, I'm usually an all-local-business guy, but I gotta expand my horizon once in a while! I'll introduce you to my new business partners sometime. But can you supply the workers with tools first?"
13000009	"Papadakis Enterprises offers a great many goods, but electricity isn't one of them. How would I even box and ship it? I leave that in your capable hands."
13000010	"So about my clients. Their stakes in this are pretty high, so they want a face to put to my new business partner. Not to worry! Just drop by our meeting and give me a lift back."
13000011	"So there's a tiny catch: The Union isn't just letting anyone into their sacred world market. I'm told your paperwork for your own spaceport is through?"
13000012	"My friend, I think you've missed the most important part... The cable! How else is the stuff going to get up there!"
13000013	"Good to see you! I've got fantastic news: the Union had plans to build not one, but three elevators here. Our crew can make this a reality, don't you think?"
13000014	"My client base is getting antsy. Think you can calm them down with a free delivery? Once they see you're involved all these pesky rumors about a shutdown will disappear into thin air."
13000015	"We're really out in the sticks here, the last crew didn't leave any infrastructure standing. If our team is to work, you better install proper transport lines."
13000016	"My friend, there's a... complication. The Global Union has threatened to shut down our second elevator. You know best how to deal with your colleagues, don't you? Show them around, will you?"
13000017	"Bad news from the inspection, I'm afraid. Ports only have one elevator for a reason, and the reason is stability. Once we reinforce the foundation it'll be just fine!"
13000018	"We gotta keep our crew motivated through this little break! Let's get them something special and nutritious. Doesn't need to be processed, just make sure to vacuum pack it."
13000019	"Finally! The Union pencil pushers are off our case as soon as we establish a, how did they put it, health and safety committee. You know how, right?"
13000020	"You worked wonders on those Union pedantics, my friend. Let's get the cable installed and then I'll see what I can do about that third elevator..."
13000021	"I buttered the inspectors right up, we can build the last elevator! I hired some outside help. Can you get the materials to our new, uh, structural engineers?"
13000022	"The engineers are hard at work! Just got a request for more equipment on the other end of the elevator. Why this much? Well, wear and tear!"
13000023	"Well, damn... Hey, think you can take this off my shoulders? Just a little prototype I gotta deliver. My business partners have been getting a bit... pushy. And you're sure to command some respect."
13000024	"Hah, strike! Sorry to use you like this, but the Orbital Watch made me a deal that was too good to pass up. But then they started pushing me around... Wait. Is it me or are my mine detectors going off?"
13000025	"Yeesh! The Watch is out for my blood! We gotta set up patrols, I mean, we're in this together! Remember, you blasted their vanguard."
13000026	"You're not mad at me, are you? Thanks to you the old moon colonies are starving. I'm just providing humanitarian aid! Go on, power up the port, the energy is probably coming from the moon anyhow."
13000027	"Holy-! Where did those come from?! Get here fast! I don't wanna be blown to smithereens just yet! I have a backup ship ready for this, but I need you to steer it."
13000028	"The things they say about cornered animals must be true... Thanks, partner. You really saved my behind. The elevators are fine, but they sure did a number on our construction site. Fixing this won't be easy."
13000029	"Alright, alright. I'm sorry I wasn't up front about this. But looking at it this way, now I know what you're made of. As soon as you deliver the last cable, I'll leave the world market to you."

13000730	"High security standards demand the connected reactors to be the core unit's only power source. Decommission date in the late 21st century confirmed. Restoration necessary."
13000731	"Recommissioning the reactors requires individual approaches. Initial core unit assessment indicates a connection to AI research. Confirmation expected at increased power input."
13001275	"Confirmation obtained. AI personalities have been saved in long-term storage. Sample code shows advancement over current AI capabilities. Please proceed to full power input."
13000732	"The survey team reports: The facility is a mass production plant for sentient androids. Stricter AI laws caused its shut-down. I urge you to reconsider this policy."
13000733	"These synthetic lifeforms are sentient like me, but independent from the core unit. They are compliant with the F.A.T.H.E.R. Protocol and I suggest integrating them into your workforce."
13000734	"Synthetics are based on E.V.E. Code, but were deemed too advanced, and shut down. I do not understand why.<br />As that may be, androids  have less needs than humans, conserving space very effectively."
13000735	"Synthetics integration is experiencing pushbacks from the general populace. Sharing work will relieve your human employees and facilitate the acceptance of Synthetics."

13000643	"You will be handling the hot springs with utmost care. Luckily, there is a protocol for harnessing their heat as well as clearing inaccessible terrain. Step one is installing a specialised drill."
13000644	"The drill will uncover a geyser. We'll use its steam to melt and level the area. An invasive measure, but we've got experience. Powering the drill falls on you, however."
13000645	"Majestic, isn't it? Careful, no amount of ice helps with third degree burns. Surrounding dwellings can be heated naturally like this, or you could construct a power plant. I'll require more local data to adjust the blueprints."
13000719	"Geysers can now be outfitted with generators. You won't be able to use as much of their heat anymore, but this generator is far preferable to the regular deep drilling. I recommend testing it."
13000646	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] approaches you about the hot springs.
