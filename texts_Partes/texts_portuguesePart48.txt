7001172  You're my best bet when it comes to getting stuff done!
7001176  Well, you tried.
7001177  One step forward, two steps back... Oh well.
7001179  Fine, I'll get it done one way or another.
7001180  Suit yourself.
7001182  The task isn't going anywhere, but it's still important.
7001183  We all have our cross to bear, and yours is that task I gave you.
7001184  I'd be taking care of it myself if I could.
7001206  That's taken care of... More work ahead!
7001207  That's good work, but we're not in the clear yet.
7001208  If we want to weather this storm, we need to stay focused.
7001587  I can see the light at the end! Just a little push now.
7001588  I hate to say this, but... one more thing.
7001280  The new batches are in the analyzer, I'm going for a smoke. And before you say anything - I know all about the Custodian's policy. Health this, nature that! I need a break.
7001281  My nephew is up there on the Moon and hasn't called in weeks. I'm afraid that the Orbital Watch is coming after him... or worse, that he's buying their propaganda. Damn, what has that idiot gotten himself into?
7001282  Howard really does love his job. You could've fooled me though - he's always so sour about everything. Then again, maybe that's his natural face.
7001283  Jorgenson is the odd one out among the Custodians. Glad he's the one manning the trading around here, makes the area a bit livelier. I met his boyfriend too, they make a cute couple.
7001284  The reclusive Arctic Custodian lifestyle just isn't for me. I think they misinterpreted the Eco's mission statement and took the austerity a bit too personally.
7001288  This vault was built following the Ebashi Trench catastrophe and its tsunamis. Things were looking pretty grim back then and people became obsessed with leaving legacies that would last.
7001289  While we Custodians are technically the Eden Initiative's successors, most of their records regarding the vaults and their contents were lost. Breaking into the vault will involve some risky trial and error.
7001589  Howard is keen on getting corporations out of the arctic. He doesn't care much what happens to the tundra plains as long as his miles of pristine snow are safe.
7001299  Alright, I know how to take care of the ice. I'm just waiting for you.
7001300  Preparations complete! I can't start working on the generator without you, though.
7001301  I've got news on the virus. You'd better get over here.
7001626  We're both eager to get into the seed vault, but first we'll need local researchers to deal with anything we find here.
7001627  Perfect. And don't worry, the nearby volcano isn't going to erupt and bury your settlement. I'm monitoring it.
7001628  But there's an actual reason to worry: we're dealing with a virus. Quarantining the sector is not an option, as we rely on outside food supplies. But with your spaceport as gateway we're on the safe side.
7001629  Good, we'll need your full corporate network if I'm right. If this is an ancient pathogen and reaches a major population center, we're in trouble.
7001630  We'll need a larger research division, but settle on that marsh and you'll be dug out in a few centuries. So first we'll have to pump it dry.
7001637  Howard is not going to like these pumps, but what's he going to do besides waggle his finger? Colonizing the tundra was his idea, after all.
7001638  The other Custodians are keen to redirect settlers over to my jurisdiction. But not on my watch, I'm only authorizing specialists. We'll need a team of experts to combat the virus.
7001639  The staff will be fine, so far the symptoms have only been observed in animals. But I'm keeping an eye on it, it's nothing that I've ever seen before.
7001640  The team was able to extract the first samples from the vault, but so far no luck in finding the virus or proving my theory. I need fresh pairs of eyes running tests on this.
7001641  The seeds the new team was able to recover show no traces of the virus. However, there's good news for you.
7001642  We've sampled a sprawling, but non-native moss species and I'm fairly certain it came from the vault. To strengthen our relationship, I've engineered a module that exploits the moss's exponential growth. Try it out!
7001643  Neat, isn't it? Just think what we'll be able to do when we secure the entire vault.
7001662  The seed vault is our goal, but we can't go waltzing in. If we repair the temperature control, we'll thaw the vault without risking the virus getting out of control.
7001663  Installing a heater for a freezer sounds paradoxical, but remember the 21st century was the era of climate change and the 22nd of climate correction. Think of this as some kind of stabilizer.
7001664  I managed to get the classified climate stabilizer blueprints. We're not copying them of course, but with enough staff we can give the old tech an overhaul.
7001666  Oh, did I say the volcano is safe? Hah, well, it is now. The Eden Initiative thought nothing would happen, but it erupted not long afterwards and buried the ventilation shafts. We'll need to clear them.
7001674  I just came back from checking on the old temperature modules and... No chance, completely fried. Global warming and climate correction took their toll. We'll need new ones.
7001676  Fuelling this machinery is anything but eco-friendl; after all we need enough power to thaw an ice layer. It's unavoidable, so let's do this right.
7001677  Good, all set to boot up!
7001678  Let's hope this goes smoothly, for all our sakes. I had the team clear out so flip the lever once you're ready.
7001679  It worked, the vault climate is stable! Wait till we fix the nuclear reactor, we'll need the temperature control for that.
7001680  When the reactor blew up my bosses just slapped a 'Do Not Enter' sign on the sector and now most of the wreckage is still lying around. We've really got our work cut out for us.
7001681  Good start. The vault and the virus will have to wait until we've taken care of this health hazard.
7001682  The reactor was built to last, but certainly not to withstand a volcanic eruption. It ruptured the cooling system and that's the first part we'll have to reconstruct.
7001683  Cleaning out all this radioactive waste is no small logistical feat, but it has to be done. No wonder closing off the sector was the easier solution.
7001684  The wreckage is mostly cleared and the cooling systems are good to go. We can get the team started on the generator itself now, just give them a lift first.
7001685  The generator is necessary to open the vault doors without destroying them. And we might have to close them again. Keep the power coming, the generator needs a push to start up.
7001687  Alright, we've got green light, we're-- hold on, I'm getting an emergency call. ... Okay, hit the activation button, we've got no time to lose. Our team just found a mutated virus strain.
7001775  Good, the nuclear reactor is stable and the doors are operational! The team is collecting samples as we speak.
7001689  Just as we suspected: It's Sprawl Fever, a formerly extinct disease with a high mortality rate that causes malignant growths. I'll need more live samples to study the mutations.
7001691  Damn. Field researchers just reported the onset of symptoms. Hurry up, you need to relocate them asap!
7001693  I'm in the middle of engineering a vaccine, but in the meantime we need medication to boost our patients' immune systems. The Arctic Custodian main branch has been informed.
7001776  You've saved many lives. And I bring good news, too!
7001701  Howard's on our side. He suggested we ship out the seeds to a better-equipped Custodian lab. Analyzing the virus is a lot harder than I thought.
7001703  My colleagues are having headaches over the virus strains, we'll need to back them up locally! Apparently one of the seed containers isn't just carrying what it says on the label.
7001704  Results are in. The irregularity they found used to be a pasta dish. I can't believe all this happened because someone dropped their lunch...
7001705  I can guess what happened. The volcano damaged the vault leaving the infected seeds exposed and voila, germination! Time to weld those leaks shut.
7001706  With the root cause of infections stamped out, we still have the mosquitoes. They're carriers of the disease and will continue to spread it until we dry out their marshes.
7001708  Excellent news! My experimental vaccine is showing promise, I'll have it deployed amongst the staff right away. The animals will have to be treated individually in the wild, however.
7001709  New infections are a risk as long as the virus is still affecting who knows how many seed containers. We'll have to expand our team to catalog them all.
7001710  The Custodians are waiting for us to clean out the vault and I've finally got something ready. Sort of a spray-on antidote and disinfectant in one. It should work.
7001777  And Howard owes you too, even though he'd never admit it.
7001716  This germinating seed is unbelievable! See how its cold-resistant properties make reactions possible at these temperatures?
7001717  So what's the new module doing for your arctic facilities? Don't tell me you haven't even installed it yet!
7001718  There was one good thing to come out of this nuclear disaster, gamma-ray absorbing organisms!
7001719  You've still got to shield your new module from meteorites, but it'll boost your production on the moon all on its own. Well, if you feed it enough.
7001720  See? This last module is the most effective! The vault is like the library of Alexandria, except we saved it.
7001721  And here I thought you were only helping me out to get your hands on the module? Maybe I was wrong about you.
7001624  My Arctic Custodian colleagues have been talking about you. If half of what they're saying is true you'll be very interested in what I've come across.
7001305  Pleased to meet you! I'm Esther Nylund, Arctic Custodian chief biologist and in charge of the Seed Vaults here. Extinct species isn't the only thing they preserved. Help me out and you'll get exclusive access.
7001623  Sorry, no entry for laypersons. You need to show some scientific background or my hands are tied.
7001306  Glad you could make it. This is a beautiful place, but isolated.
7001307  That might be the reason the Eden Initiative chose this place. Two centuries ago, they built a Seed Vault here to preserve now extinct species. That's what we're after.
7001308  However, the vault hasn't been maintained properly and has leaks. It's brought something else with it from the past, something dangerous.
7001312  I'm a scientist, not a miracle worker!
7001315  I'm not a physicist myself, but that's what our team is for. Still, we're not ready.
7001350  I'm working round the clock, but glaring at the centrifuge won't make it spin any faster, believe me.
7001318  Thanks. I mean it.
7001711  But before we can get into the vault proper we've got to fix the blown temperature control. I'll get the plans ready, stay tuned.
7001712  I'll get the operation ready. In the meantime I've got good news: the team engineered a cold-resistant module using their new findings!
7001713  Now it's my turn. I'll let you know once I have the first results on those mutated strains. For now you can test the new modules, we've modified them for lunar operation.
7001714  We've already got results. You can now install new modules that are especially effective in moderate climates.
7001715  We've defeated the virus, once and for all! The team is archiving centuries of samples. Looks like the Eden Initiative's endeavor wasn't for nothing!
7001578  That's going to be a cakewalk, right?
7001579  I'm sure you'll manage just fine.
7001580  Make sure to be thorough.
7001581  Thanks!
7001582  Much appreciated!
7001583  Ta!
7001584  Well then, let's get to work!
7001585  No time to waste, let's get right to it.
7001586  I'll leave you to do your thing, then.
7001590  We both do what we have to do, I get it.
7001591  Playing by the books in the arctic and not a single care out here?
7001592  And here I thought your energy production didn't rely on fossil fuels.
7001593  It took well over a hundred years to get the arctic back, but sure, burn away.
7001594  I'm already looking the other way. Now it seems I also need a pair of earmuffs.
7001595  If this is the price I have to pay to get this sector secured...
7001596  Back already from corporate meetings? I'm not complaining.
7001597  Já te disse, sem a devida autorização ninguém...! Oh! Você não é Howard.
7001598  Venho defendendo o forte, é hora de trocar a guarda.
7001599  Ai está.
7001600  Precisa de mais alguma coisa?
7001601  E eu pensei que você já teria se cansado disso...
7001602  Vou olhar mais tarde.
7001604  Parece útil.
7001605  Não desperdice, não deseje.
7001606  Oh, eu queria estocar isso!
7001607  É caro despachar coisas daqui, então... obrigado.
7001608  Não há mais vida selvagem no pântano, então vá em frente.
7001609  O pântano é difícil de navegar. A instalação da bomba demorará um pouco.
7001610  Grande expansão, hein?
7001611  Você pode começar a drenagem agora.
7001612  Você vai ter que ligar as bombas também.
7001613  Não deixe o pântano esperando...
7001614  Isso vai demorar um pouco, pegue uma cadeira.
7001615  Toda aquela água tem que ir para algum lugar!
7001616  As bombas estão fazendo seu trabalho.
7001617  Menos pântano, mais terra.
7001618  Finalmente. As bombas são um verdadeiro pé no saco.
7001619  Bom trabalho. Moisés.
7001741  Caminhar na lama é divertido, mas não muito.
7001742  Por que a demora?
7001743  Você pode pagar por isso, certo?
7001747  O pântano está tão seco quanto uma conversa com Howard. É hora de desmontar a bomba.
7001748  O solo não ficará mais seco.
7001749  Não há mais perigo de afundar!
7001761  Olha isso? Os sintomas são visíveis até mesmo para leigos.
7001762  Não chegue muito perto.
7001763  Estamos monitorando. Não há mais nada que possamos fazer agora.
