13000011	"So there's a tiny catch: The Union isn't just letting anyone into their sacred world market. I'm told your paperwork for your own spaceport is through?"
13000012	"My friend, I think you've missed the most important part... The cable! How else is the stuff going to get up there!"
13000013	"Good to see you! I've got fantastic news: the Union had plans to build not one, but three elevators here. Our crew can make this a reality, don't you think?"
13000014	"My client base is getting antsy. Think you can calm them down with a free delivery? Once they see you're involved all these pesky rumors about a shutdown will disappear into thin air."
13000015	"We're really out in the sticks here, the last crew didn't leave any infrastructure standing. If our team is to work, you better install proper transport lines."
13000016	"My friend, there's a... complication. The Global Union has threatened to shut down our second elevator. You know best how to deal with your colleagues, don't you? Show them around, will you?"
13000017	"Bad news from the inspection, I'm afraid. Ports only have one elevator for a reason, and the reason is stability. Once we reinforce the foundation it'll be just fine!"
13000018	"We gotta keep our crew motivated through this little break! Let's get them something special and nutritious. Doesn't need to be processed, just make sure to vacuum pack it."
13000019	"Finally! The Union pencil pushers are off our case as soon as we establish a, how did they put it, health and safety committee. You know how, right?"
13000020	"You worked wonders on those Union pedantics, my friend. Let's get the cable installed and then I'll see what I can do about that third elevator..."
13000021	"I buttered the inspectors right up, we can build the last elevator! I hired some outside help. Can you get the materials to our new, uh, structural engineers?"
13000022	"The engineers are hard at work! Just got a request for more equipment on the other end of the elevator. Why this much? Well, wear and tear!"
13000023	"Well, damn... Hey, think you can take this off my shoulders? Just a little prototype I gotta deliver. My business partners have been getting a bit... pushy. And you're sure to command some respect."
13000024	"Hah, strike! Sorry to use you like this, but the Orbital Watch made me a deal that was too good to pass up. But then they started pushing me around... Wait. Is it me or are my mine detectors going off?"
13000025	"Yeesh! The Watch is out for my blood! We gotta set up patrols, I mean, we're in this together! Remember, you blasted their vanguard."
13000026	"You're not mad at me, are you? Thanks to you the old moon colonies are starving. I'm just providing humanitarian aid! Go on, power up the port, the energy is probably coming from the moon anyhow."
13000027	"Holy-! Where did those come from?! Get here fast! I don't wanna be blown to smithereens just yet! I have a backup ship ready for this, but I need you to steer it."
13000028	"The things they say about cornered animals must be true... Thanks, partner. You really saved my behind. The elevators are fine, but they sure did a number on our construction site. Fixing this won't be easy."
13000029	"Alright, alright. I'm sorry I wasn't up front about this. But looking at it this way, now I know what you're made of. As soon as you deliver the last cable, I'll leave the world market to you."
