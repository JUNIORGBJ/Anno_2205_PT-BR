115199	"It's the Moon. Can't produce anything ourselves. That here's just the urgent supplies."
115200	"No IDs, barely said somethin', just handed a list of supplies. Possibly dangerous, but probably just desperate."
115201	"Engine hickup. Crew is waitin' and killin' time playin' cards, I imagine. Us moon folk are easy-going."
115202	"That's not a long-distance vehicle, I don't know how these refugees managed to get this far."
115203	"Abandoned spy buggy. Wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole, though. Those red and blue wires look fishy."
115204	"Basically a bunch of junk blocking our routes. Dismantling 'em isn't worth the effort."

115221	"With you escorting our miners the Orbital Watch won't dare attack us, I hope. They keep an eye on the route."
115222	"Production went a bit too well, so our transporter is overloaded. We need additional horsepower here."
115223	"We've got a strict protocol when it comes to abandoned vehicles. And in such a case the rules are simple."
115224	"Terrorists on the horizon! Evacuating the area would take too long, so we have to go the hard way."
115225	"We can't dig up the whole area just to find one cache. Good thing the LEC marked it."
115226	"We hid the goods in an attempt to lure the Orbital Watch into a trap. But they smelled the rat and hid our stuff."
115227	"An anonymous woman is offering us information. However, she uses an unorthodox handover method..."
115228	"The Orbital Watch intercepted our cargo shuttles just as they wanted to take off. And their guards are even better than their thieves."
115229	"The Orbital Watch has been spying on us. Better make sure these route coordinates not fall into their hands."
115230	"Our LEC clients don't want to be seen trading with us. Too afraid of the damn Watch."
115231	"An Orbital Watch vehicle, completely unmanned! A gold mine for tactical information. Just have to strike at it!"
115232	"We couldn't verify the crew's identity, but they sent a distress signal. Hope it's not a trap."
115233	"It's a possible scenario. And our soldiers should be prepared, this could happen any day."
115234	"These Orbital Watch vehicles are drawing close. Just stay out of their radar. Vacuum will obscure the rest."

117030	"Terrorists have seized our new battleship. If they start recreating it... you wouldn't want that!"
117031	"There's a hefty reward on this captain. Sink them. Cassian is willing to share and share alike."
117032	"Sometimes, destruction is necessary. Like when we ourselves are in danger."
117033	"Don't tell me you're not trying to get an edge over Saayman? In this battle nothing will be prosecuted."
117034	"Those bastards sunk our convoy. Please, return our shipment while we tend to the survivors!"
117035	"My material budget is tight. I'm not happy being out here, but this is where the good stuff is."
117036	"Any lost cargo can help us identify who these terrorists are. We can count on you, can't we?"
117037	"I have a keen interest in sturdy metals. Plus, there is no accounting to be done out here."
117038	"Sidestepping Cassian Industries and selling their goods yourself is quite lucrative. Let me make you an offer."
117039	"Soon the Union will take over this sector and all its riches will go to waste."
117040	"These landmines will be a menace for years to come... Bring me some and I'll see if I can defuse them!"
117041	"Mines are really quite valuable. The materials are quite expensive. What a waste, having them explode!"
117042	"Warning the Union about this mine-infested sector will help us all. Of course, we need proof first."
117043	"Our interference transmitters are power hungry. Help us out and we won't put them to use against you."
117044	"We're here to protect any civilians gone astray. I'm certain you'll support this endeavor."
117045	"Err, yeah, our shield experiments drained our energy... Could you help me jump start this thing?"
117085	"Here to help us out? Great, we could use an ally with firepower right about now!"
117086	"We're in danger and have no defense systems! And why would we need one, until now?!"
117087	"I despise violence, but this sector mustn't fall to the Watch! Lead the charge, we'll hold position."
117088	"We need backup or these terrorists will bomb our research glacier into oblivion!"
117089	"We're here to salvage what the bastards bombarded earlier. Watch our backs?"
117090	"Our observatorium... Nothing's left. If you'd send more troops in, we could prevent further losses!"
117091	"Forcing enemy ships to a standstill can save lives. I've seen it happen more than once."
117092	"I was part of the R&D team that developed these EM Pulses. I can attest to their efficiency."
117093	"We surrendered! But they just kept shooting at us! Go give those bastards hell in our name."
117094	"We've rewired our power supply to keep up the shields. So don't worry about us, repair you own fleet."
117095	"Being in the field tires anyone out. But don't just keep a stock of Drones, actually use them!"
117096	"Repairing your ship won't do you any good once it's at the bottom of the ocean. Always stay vigilant."
117097	"Activating your shields makes the difference between scrapping and repairing. It did for us, anyway."
117098	"Repairing high-tec fleets like yours is complicated, so make sure not to get hit in the first place."
117099	"Kinetic Shields have the side-effect of reducing friction. That way you could outrun anyone!"
117100	"We can't leave yet, but we need some sort of warn signals. A few strategically placed mines should do."
117101	"Building a barricade out of mines is a great defense tactic. That's how we've been holding our position."
117102	"Mines are a biological disaster, but we'll have to look past fish populations this once!"
117103	"The terrorists saw our flag and attacked. Didn't matter to them if we're just a frozen food transport."
117104	"If not for the trader guy to distract the attackers, we wouldn't have made it here... I hope he's alright."
117105	"Can you believe people go diving out here for fun? Good we found them, but now we need a lift! Hurry!"
117106	"The evacuation of this sector is ongoing, we've just secured another isolated research team."
117107	"What is the Global Union doing besides twirling their thumbs? At least you can get us out of here."
117108	"We have deep-frozen research specimens on board, they musn't be risked at all costs."
117070	"Just having some missiles will scare any terrorists off! Not like I can use them anyhow..."
117071	"Look, I'm I'd rather quit trading than become an arms dealer, but the Custodians seriously need ammunition!"
117072	"Custodian friends of mine are asking for a few missiles. For research! At least last I heard..."
117073	"Am I glad to see you! But please, don't just leave me here alone! Please!"
117074	"If you left me with a small fleet, I could coordinate supplies lines around here!"
