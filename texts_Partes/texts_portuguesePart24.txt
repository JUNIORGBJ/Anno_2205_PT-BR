113469	Um, you do know that you can be tracked via the Net whenever your mobile is on, right?
113470	Okay, maybe they couldn't see you, but your electronic footprint was off the scale!
113471	Right. The satellites show you're in the right area, so keep your eyes peeled.
113472	Okay, it looks like you're in the right area. Start refining your search parameters now.
113473	You should be hitting the target area now. Switch from nav to scanners and scan the area.
113474	Scanned and logged. That's it, alright.
113475	Okay, my scan data shows that's the one. Good work.
113476	Told you you'd find it if you just trust your info and your gear.
114978	Let's skip the introduction. Already know enough about you. And not much to tell about me, other than I like to... push a few buttons every now and then.
115813	Whoa, you generated some buzz. A lot of decision makers would like to have your support. Like, where the real decisions are made. Think about it.
115814	This is where the course of the world economy is decided. You can influence those decisions. It all depends on who you support. I'll make some recommendations here and there.
116036	Well looky here, a new player in the world economy. Easy to lose track, what with all the options available. But I'm here to offer some incentives.
115810	Never guessed you'd be so conservative. Come on, make your voice count!
115811	The world won't wait for you to change it. Make your choice, make a difference.
115812	Still sticking by the corporation? You could have a voice in world-shaking decisions, you know...
105541	Ah, welcome to Papadakis' Cash and Carry! Whatever it is, Nic is sure to have it... Ah, that! Yes, of course, I have one right here! Super condition. Go ahead, look around!
115482	A little birdy told me you're searchin' for a special piece of tech. As chance would have it, I've just... come by one. We'll talk at my warehouse.
115483	Only the finest quality. Help yourself, my friend!
115484	Don't say anything, my friend! I have just what you're looking for. It's yours, if you don't ask any questions.
116294	Remember our little deal, my friend? You should have another look!
116295	You're not leavin' everything to ol' Nic, are you? There's a lot to do with that project.
116296	My friend, our project needs a little love, know what I mean?
116297	Hello there, my friend. Got myself a little project to keep me busy, Want to join in?
116298	I'm only making this offer to you! This little project of mine - I want you in.
116299	I've got an opportunity for you, my friend, you just won't believe! Come over!
115287	That's somethin' for ol' Nic! I love it, when things go right! I'd like to watch this from up close!
115288	Plannin' for the great happenin', huh? Heard you invited all my business partners! But you're not giving us only veggies to chew on, right?
115289	My friend, thank you for the invitation! Gotta like this place! Very comfortable!
115290	You saved me, my friend! I thought this would be the end of ol' Nic!
115291	That's gonna be a ball, my friend! The perfect setting to talk some business with my partners, in private.
108332	Any news on that job yet?
108333	How's that job going? Any problems?
108334	Good to see you, my friend. So, how's that little job going?
108336	That job going okay, or is there something I need to know?
108337	So. How's our little project going?
108339	Forgive my impatience. I just want to have the matter out of the way.
108340	Yes! Yes, that's it!
108342	That's it, alright.
108343	That's the one.
108344	I see you found it.
108346	That's the one I meant, yes.
108347	You've got it!
108348	That's where you gotta go.
108349	Nic gave you a pretty good map, huh?
108350	Yes, yes, that's the spot!
108351	Good, you found the right spot.
108352	Gotta say, you read a map better than most, my friend.
108354	Right. Now hustle on over there.
108355	Good. Now get a move on, will you?
108391	Look, this isn't exactly legit, but you wouldn't lose by it, my friend.
108392	Interested in a little trip? A... very, very quiet trip.
108393	How good are you at not bein' seen?
108394	You interested in makin' some money, but real quiet like?
108395	Good job! Guess this kinda makes us partners in crime, huh.
108396	Nice! Remember though, nobody says nothing.
108397	Smooth, real smooth, my friend.
108398	Hey, you want to get us thrown in jail, or what?
108399	If they catch you first, you don't know me! Got it?
108400	Some people just don't have the soul, know what I mean?
115471	Look who blew in! Sam Beaumont's drawing card, in the game for the Moon! Nicolo Papadakis, but you can call me Nic. If you're lookin' for a good deal, no questions asked... my warehouse is always open to you.
115476	Ah, I knew there was somethin' goin' on here! Nic Papadakis, Papadakis Enterprises! You want a good deal, just come to my warehouse!
115479	Oh, a new face. Welcome to my little family business. Nic Papadakis, Papadakis Enterprises. Lookin' for quality goods in wholesale quantities? Then look no further than Nic's.
115677	My friend, welcome to Papadakis Enterprises. Can't wait to do business with you! Business friendships are the truest friendships...
115501	A small world, huh! Wherever you go, ol' Nic has been there. And where Nic goes, he brings shiploads of quality goods!
115502	You out here too, my friend? What a lucky shot for us both! Our dealings won't be impeded by distance.
115503	Papadakis Enterprises. Doin' business where the business is. Come and pay your ol' friend a visit!
115498	No way you're gonna avoid makin' a deal or two with ol' Nic. I'll make you a good price.
115499	Haven't seen ya round here lately. How 'bout some horse tradin' amongst friends, huh?
115500	You don't buy from me, you don't sell to me. You're breaking ol' Nic's heart.
115480	Quite the do-it-yourself kinda CEO, aren't you? Drop by my harbor it's always a good place to find lucrative Assignments.
115481	Command Ships. Best way of takin' care of business out at sea. Have you ever considered accepting some Assignments at my harbor? It pays well.
115497	Hey, my friend. Lots of people are asking for you. Want to offer you some Assignments. Come over, huh?
109241	That's good news.
109242	Alright.
109243	That's what I like to hear.
109244	That should make life easier.
109245	Good thing.
109247	Gotta like that.
109248	Good thing that's outta the way.
109249	That's one less thing to worry about.
109250	One less headache.
109251	Hey, you done good!
109252	You're makin' Nic a happy man!
109253	You sure don't beat around the bush, do you?
109254	You just made my day!
109256	I gotta tell you, you're slick.
109258	You did a good thing out there today.
109259	Nicely done, my friend.
109260	I like the way you work.
109262	Today's maybe not so good.
109263	That coulda gone better.
109264	That's not gonna help.
109265	Gotta admit, that's kinda disappointing.
109266	Some days aren't worth gettin' outta bed for, eh?
109267	What's this world comin' to?
109269	This has gotta be a joke.
109270	I can't believe it.
109271	That won't help business at all.
109275	What were you thinking?
109276	You're just pulling Nic's leg, right?
109277	Come on, I'm sure you can do better than that.
109278	You're kiddin', right?
109279	I kind of expected more of you, my friend.
109280	If that's the best you can do, then we are in serious trouble.
109282	You're gonna have to do better than that.
109283	Tell me that didn't just happen.
108427	Welcome to Nic's.
108429	Hey! Come on in.
108431	You came to the right place. Nic has it all.
108432	Welcome to Nic's House of Incredibly Desirable Commodities.
108434	Lookin' for a good deal? I got nothin' but the best!
109284	Nic's, the home of savings!
109285	My prices are so low, even I don't know how I do it.
109288	Hey, look who's here! Good to see ya!
109289	How are you doin'? Long time, no see!
109290	Hey, good to see you, my friend!
109292	Well, if it isn't my favorite customer!
109293	This day is gettin' better by the minute! Come on in!
109294	Good of you to drop in to see me.
109295	Welcome aboard, my friend!
109296	Sure, why not?
109297	Of course.
109298	Happy to.
109299	My pleasure.
109300	No problem.
109301	For you? Of course.
109302	You know all you gotta do is ask.
109303	You know Nic will always help.
109304	Sure, you got it.
109306	Sorry, not today. Tomorrow isn't lookin' so good either.
109307	I don't think so.
109308	The answer is no.
109309	Sorry, no can do.
109310	I think I'm gonna have to say no.
109311	I'd like to help you, but my hands are tied.
109312	You didn't just ask me that, did you?
109313	My friend, I'll just pretend you didn't ask.
109315	Sorry, my friend, can't help you there.
108308	Good of you to drop by! Say, I got a little something needs doing…
108309	Look who's here! You wouldn't be looking for something to do, would you?
108310	Just the one I wanted to see. Mind lending me a hand?
108311	Talk about the right place at the right time! Looking for work?
108315	Didn't expect you out here. Mind helping me out?
108316	What are you doing out here? Busy?
108317	Fancy running into you here. I got a job for you.
108321	I knew you were the right one for the job!
108322	You done great out there, my friend.
108323	Good job out there!
108324	Couldn't have done it better myself!
108325	Now that's the way it's supposed to be done.
108326	I knew you'd do ol' Nic proud!
108329	Are you tryin' to tell me that was the best you could do?
108330	C'mon. You're joking, right? What was that supposed to be?
108331	My friend, I ain't gonna lie. That was pretty pathetic.
113429	Hey, now what?
113430	You're not bailing on me, are you?
113431	My friend, some things just go wrong.
108368	Great job, my friend, but... something else came up. You still in?
108369	Thank you but there's still a little something to be done…
108370	You got that done pretty well. Ready for your next job?
108371	I got something needs takin' care of. Needs a... firm hand, if you get my drift.
108372	If you're not afraid of a little rough and tumble, I might have something for you.
108373	I got a little job needs doin'. Might be a little push and shove involved, know what I mean?
108374	There's something that needs to be done, and it might require a little muscle.
108375	Nic's got a little job for you, if you're not afraid of gettin' your hands dirty.
108376	You, my friend, are no one to mess with.
108377	Ol' Nic knew you'd take care of it. No one messes with you much, do they?
108378	Nice job you did there. Smooth, efficient - final.
108384	Well, at least you're alive, my friend. But you'll have to do better next time.
108385	Pah! You gotta learn how to aim your guns!
108386	That was a joke. You got your ass shot off, my friend.
109341	Welcome to my humble place of business.
109342	Welcome to Ol' Nic's!
109343	You've come to the right place!
109344	We are open for business!
109345	Welcome to my place!
109348	Welcome to Nic's, where the smart money comes.
109351	No one beats Nic's deals.
109352	Always a pleasure, my friend!
109353	You, my friend, have a very good eye.
109354	I like a customer who knows what they want.
109355	I know you'll find that very useful!
109356	Yeah, right. Make an offer I can't refuse.
109357	My friend, we have a deal.
109358	Nic knows a bargain when he sees one!
109359	The right stuff at the right price.
109360	No way I'm gonna say no to a deal like that!
109361	Business friendships are the truest friendships. Wouldn't you agree, my friend?
109362	I tell you, nothing beats sealing a deal that's gonna keep you fed for years to come. Speakin' of which, I wonder what that Volodin needs all the oil for...
109363	The communicator! Ah, don't mind it, my friend. Must be the Global Union Board of Customs. They'll call again. Pretty persistent bunch, let me tell you!
109364	Yes, the Beaumont girl seems sweet enough. But a bit of a stickler for the rules, don't ya think? Must've worked hard just to get where she is now. There are easier ways!
109365	Been working forever to get a license from this Dr. Young. Touchy, touchy fellas, those Arctic Custodians. Well, except this one arctic trader, what was his name? Just the opposite of the doctor. But not nearly as useful.
108401	I know what they say about me. But they all come to me, just the same. Hypocrites.
108403	The world isn't all black and white, my friend. You gotta live in the grey.
108404	Without people like me, nothin' would ever get done around here.
108405	In this life, you're either a fish or a shark.
108406	It's a tough world out there, my friend. Never forget that.
108407	You do what you have to, to get by. Never forget that.
108408	In business, my friend, you're either a fish or a shark. And we all know that fish are nearly extinct.
108409	I just love the ocean.
113432	They spotted us! Move, move!
113433	You gotta learn to stay out of sight, my friend.
113434	Sometimes it's bad to be the center of attention.
113435	Better slow down and have a look around.
113436	You're almost there. Just keep your eyes peeled.
113437	Alright. Gotta be around there somewhere.
113438	What do you know? You got it!
113439	Ol' Nic knew you'd find it!
113440	So... you found it! Can Nic pick 'em, or what?
114980	Ah, so you're the risin' star everyone's talking about. Nicolo Papadakis, Papadakis Enterprises. My friends call me Nic. And good customers are always friends of mine!
115879	Ah, there you are! Everyone everywhere is talkin' about you. And as I always say: Sure, that's a friend of mine! You still remember your friends, right?
13000046	A little birdy told me you're searchin' for a special piece of tech. As chance would have it, I've just ... come by one.
13000050	Smooth, real smooth, my friend. That should make life easier.
13000052	Good job out there! You do what you have to to get by. Never forget that.
115899	Don't listen to him, okay? Just keep going!
115900	Sweet. But no rest for the wicked. That's not the only Stabilizer the Orbital Watch took off us.
115901	That's it! Whew, thanks! I'm really grateful! Seriously, you just prevented a new climate catastrophe.
115974	There. See the mess? Transmitters generating interference all over the place. Plus battleships to guard them.
115975	I'd like to hear Dr. Maverick explain just how we're supposed to cope with such a force, exactly. Glad you're not letting us down here.
115976	Just get rid of the transmitters and things should go back to normal. For now, at least.
116330	Storm's over. Thanks... now we can get back to business.
105604	Yo, don't listen to him. Man, we got nothing to counter these attacks.
115789	Whew... good riddance! We reclaimed the main Stabilizers. The Orbital Watch still controls a large portion of the minor ones, but we're safe for now.
116323	Whoa, sweet! Guess we're gonna see more trade coming through here soon! By the way, the Custodians asked me to provide you the construction tech you need for your spaceport.
116324	Man, I'm so glad you came here! Look at all this traffic! Business has never been so good! Lemme return the favor! I'll deliver the construction machinery for your icebreaker docks! It's on the house!
116325	Okay, about the stuff for your icebreaker docks... All the storms in the area are making it impossible for my freighters to get through. Sorry!
116326	Good news! The Arctic Custodians commissioned me to get you the tech stuff you need for your icebreaker docks. It's already on the way!
116327	Spooky! There shouldn't be any storms up here at all. Our Climate Stabilizers produce totally predictable weather.
116328	Finally! The ships have arrived. Ordered them to unload your stuff directly at the spaceport.
116329	Um... don't mean to disappoint you. But until this Climate Stabilizer problem is solved, my suppliers refuse to enter the sector. No delivery for you 'til it's taken care of.
119695	Yo, don't listen to him. We got nothing to counter such attacks!
116300	Hey! The project's up and running again! Come over!
116301	Yo, I could use a helping hand with our project.
116302	Yeah, 'bout our project. I guess you're needed again!
116303	Hey, mind helping me out a bit? It's something big.
116304	Don't mean to hassle you or nothin', but could you drop by sometime?
116305	Look, I got this... ah, thing going on here. Wanna maybe have a look?
116311	Yo, this area's Custodians only. I may not... Ah, stuff those stupid rules! We're in big trouble here. Got a minute?
114880	Sweet. I'm not really allowed to tell you this, but I've had it up to here with all that Arctic Custodian lone wolf crap!
114881	Fact is, this Climate Stabilizer here's gone crazy. I'm not, like, any kind of expert, but I've been entrusted with monitoring this thing. Not much trade coming my way anyhow…
114889	Okay, materials and stuff have arrived, thanks.
114882	And as messed up as it is, I thought we'd call in a corp to help us out. As long as no one tells Dr. Ice Block…
114884	Okay, we're gonna remove the old Troposphere Regulator for repairs now.
115508	We're also gonna fix all the smaller defects, okay? Gonna take a while.
114885	Our construction bots are working flat out. But you have to give us a little more time. There's something seriously wrong with this Regulator!
114958	Yo, there's news on the Stabilizer! And you shouldn't wonder. Way things are, I had to inform Dr. Young, too...
114887	Just in the nick of time! The climate here's already going down the tubes. Better get back to the repairs.
114888	Gonna take some time to integrate the Troposphere Regulator. I'll catch you later.
114890	Whohoo, all right! I'd say the weather forecast is gonna be a lot more accurate from now on! Thanks, man!
114891	Pretty cold out here now, huh? That's how you know our Stabilizer is running smoothly.
114892	Nice weather, huh? What's that old saying? Make profit while the sun shines. Something like that, anyway.
114893	Sorry, man, but as long as it's pouring cats and dogs out there, I'm staying in here.
114894	Uh uh, no way, man... I hate thunder.
114895	It's natural spectacles like those that make people stay here. Seein' life in a beautiful light, so to say.
115530	Please don't listen to Dr. Worrywart. Tell you what. You make me a partner, and I'll get you the blueprints for a better icebreaker!
116037	The Orbital Watch still has a good chunk of our Climate Stabilizers under their control. They're using some sort of interference transmitter or something to mess around with them. Please, do something about it.
116038	Whew! Good you're here! No one else I can turn to! The Orbital Watch is playing around with our Stabilizers! If someone destroyed the jamming devices they've attached, we could regain control.
116039	Still don't have the situation with the hijacked Climate Stabilizers under control. I mean, it's not like we have a battlefleet or anything. If you could retake the Stabilizers for us, me and my people would be really grateful.
116046	Hm, it's only one. There are more in the network here.
116047	You're gonna have to free them all to return the climate here back to normal. Keep going!
116048	They control all the Stabilizers in this sector. We're not done yet!
116050	It's just ahead. That's one of the Stabilizers they took over.
116051	See that jamming device, there? That's how they control them.
116052	Almost there. That's one of the hijacked Climate Stabilizers.
110839	How cool is that.
110841	Wow, nice one! Sweet!
110842	That's some real good news.
110843	Cool.
110844	Am I glad to hear that.
110845	That totally rocks.
110846	Sweet.
110847	Good stuff.
110848	Yeah, all good.
110849	Likin' it.
110850	Whew, talk about a relief!
110851	Whew, that sure feels better.
110852	Wow, that's a load off my mind.
110853	You were awesome!
110854	You do good work.
110855	Nice going. I mean real nice going.
110856	That was some good work there, you know?
110857	You did a pretty cool job.
110859	You aced it!
110862	You did quite well!
110863	Ah, what a bummer.
110864	That kinda sucks.
110865	That isn't good. Not at all.
110866	Not so cool.
110867	Beastly, beastly.
110868	That's so not good.
110869	I just don't believe it.
110870	That really ain't gonna help.
110872	What a downer.
110873	Not that I'm disappointed but, I mean, y'know …
110874	I really hoped you'd do better.
110875	Please don't tell me you screwed that up.
110876	Look, it sounds harsh, but you really messed up.
110877	Don't sweat it. It'll all be fine, know what I mean?
110878	It's not like you can't do better!
110879	I know how you feel. I've been there!
110880	You blew that one.
110881	You really messed that up something bad.
110883	Yo! How you doin'?
110884	Come on in and hang out.
110885	Oh, hey! Everything cool?
110886	Ah, real glad you dropped by.
110887	Come on in and chill a bit.
110888	Wow, look who came in out of the cold!
110891	Hey! Thanks for coming over!
110892	There's some serious winter out there! Why don't you come in here and thaw.
110893	Sure thing!
110894	No problemo.
110895	Sure, no prob.
110896	Like, for sure.
110897	Sure, happy to.
110899	Admit it, you knew I'd say yes.
