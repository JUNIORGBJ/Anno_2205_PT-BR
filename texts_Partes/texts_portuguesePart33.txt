112798	Not at the moment.
112799	I am sorry, but I am very busy.
112800	Sorry, I have too much on my desk as it is.
112801	I'm sorry, but I have to disappoint you.
112802	Please, don't count on it happening.
112803	You have to understand that the department needs my full attention.
112804	Sorry, I don't have any staff I can spare you right now.
112805	I hate to cancel on you, but I must.
112806	I don't want the responsibility. This is for you to look after.
112807	That is a top-level issue.
112808	The time has been assigned to leave you free to take care of everything.
112809	It's already making itself felt on the markets. You have to act.
112810	Our shareholders would like you to interpose.
112811	Our staff is growing nervous about this.
112812	You really should give yourself a bonus for that!
112813	Our company stands for excellence. And so does our CEO.
112814	You are the future of the world economy!
112815	Thank you! Everybody will profit from that!
112816	What can I say? Excellent!
112817	Please accept my congratulations.
112818	Everything looks very good. Thank you!
112819	I suppose it pays to leave these matters to the boss!
112820	I hope we are covered legally.
112821	From bad to worse.
112822	Now, how am I supposed to explain this to our shareholders?
112823	Schedule difficulties, I presume?
112824	We cannot procrastinate forever.
112825	Fine, I'll have everything canceled.
112826	So, what are the prospects?
112827	The prognoses look promising. How far along are you with the implementation?
112828	Of course. Here is another dossier on the matter...
112829	You want to discuss this matter again?
112830	The press has been asking. What can I tell them about your progress?
112831	I don't want to seem impatient, but I have to report back to the shareholders.
112832	What is the status on that assignment?
112833	Several departments are demanding updated information. Any news?
112834	This is the one, I suppose.
112835	You have located it.
112836	Everything's where it's supposed to be.
112837	All ready for delivery.
112838	Exactly.
112839	Nothing escapes you, it seems.
112840	It seems like the one on the assignment form.
112841	Please, take care of this one.
112842	Everybody is preparing for your arrival, I hear.
112843	It seems you don't need directions.
112844	This way.
112845	My secretary has already announced your arrival.
112846	You are awaited.
112847	Yes, this the exact location.
112848	I cannot send someone. You have to go yourself.
112849	This is the place mentioned.
112850	They have found us.
112851	We're not spending enough on camouflage systems, it seems.
112852	You acted too suspicious.
112853	You are on the right path.
112854	Yes, it must be in the vicinity.
112855	Our search will soon be at an end.
112856	That's what we were looking for.
112857	That seems to be it.
112858	Definitely. That must be it.
112859	Thank you. Now that I have your ear, could you see about this as well?
112860	Very good. But this matter requires some additional attention.
112861	I see this requires a multi-step solution.
112862	These people are a danger to the company!
112863	This threatens our routes as well. I hope you intervene soon.
112864	I'm afraid we will not solve this issue without military action.
112865	The staff hopes you won't turn a blind eye to this menace.
112866	Our shareholders demand that you put an end to this violence.
112867	I congratulate you on this victory.
112868	Hm, your strategies pay off on the battlefield, as well.
112869	A heavy-handed response, I would say.
112870	This will burn a hole in our military budget.
112871	Such a loss.
112872	We underestimated the opposition.
112873	Everyone is always complaining! I am sick and tired of it!
112874	Overtime again! Someone must smooth out all the directors' mistakes!
112875	Please, if you'll excuse me, I have to go fire some people!
112877	It's my job to make decisions for them. But I am just as helpless against this... hysteria.
112878	The responsibility nags at you, now that everything is going to the dogs...
112880	If it keeps going on like this, I'll take it to the labor court.
112881	Expenses this high and no comfort to show for them, either!
112882	You're playing with peoples' livelihoods here!
112876	My employees constantly ask me about their futures! Do I look like I have the answers?
112884	They say we decision makers sit around all day. But it's still work.
112887	Between us, this enterprise could be so much more!
112889	My career just goes round in circles. But never mind.
112891	I had imagined a leadership position to be more... satisfying.
112883	The numbers look alright. I won't complain.
112885	I think everything is well organized here.
112886	I've been in worse companies, certainly.
112888	The atmosphere? About what you'd expect.
112890	A meeting? I wouldn't know what to talk about.
112892	What is to say? Everything is the way it always is.
112893	I thought about a home office. But then I wouldn't get out to see the beautiful cityscape.
112894	I got a bonus recently, so yes, I'm doing fine!
112895	I had the complaint box removed. It was always empty anyway.
112896	We're doing some good business at the moment. Sure, that affects our mood.
112897	I have built myself quite a good life here, wouldn't you say?
112898	I had big windows installed in the meeting rooms. Seeing this skyline creates ideas.
112899	People often approach me for raises. I'm glad I can grant them.
112900	What's not to like about this company?
112901	Business trips? Yes. But I would miss the office, certainly.
112902	I really like it here. This atmosphere of contentedness.
112903	No matter what perks they offer me... I wouldn't work for anyone else!
112904	Cancel all my appointments! I have to buy this incredible CEO here a lunch!
112905	You really are exemplary! Both as an employer and as a person!
112906	I am certain there will be lots of opportunities for us all in the future!
112907	The company is just like one big family! And I'm a family kind of person, you know?
112908	I always wanted a job with guaranteed chances of advancement!
112909	Thanks for all you have done for us!
112910	I don't know how you do this!
112911	All the important decisions! And I have a voice in them!
112912	What a city!
112913	A good choice! We don't have enough of those.
112914	I take it you read the infrastructure reports. Very good!
112915	That will take the edge off rush hour. Thank you!
112916	May I introduce myself?
112917	I am looking forward to working with you.
112918	Thank you for the opportunity.
112919	The Big Five divided the world markets amongst themselves. So we'll just open new markets in space, right?
112920	I saw a computer simulation of how they did business in the 15th century. I should definitely get myself a sailing ship.
112921	Between you and me, the big enterprises are the powers that be in the world today. We shouldn't miss our chance.
112922	The energy market will likely collapse soon. I'm glad I get my electricity directly from you and not from Liu Xing.
112923	Sometimes I get tired of all the old clichés: All managers fly sports cars and play PlasmaTag all day.
115565	A small miracle the economy hasn't collapsed yet.
115566	Cutting salaries isn't fun for me, either.
115567	Alright, but just a short lunch break.
115568	Why won't the baby sitter pick up?
115569	This city is beautiful, I should go out more.
115570	Smaller than Earth, but so impressive...
115571	Can't wait for the trip, better get ready!
115572	I feel like I should try cooking tonight.
115595	We'll order more desinfectants.
115606	We'll see what we can do.
115609	No! I almost made it! This is illogical!
115977	Well, that's quite a sum... but, your stellar career should be guarantee enough that our money is well-invested.
115294	My, what a lovely atmosphere! Figuratively speaking, of course.
115295	I've seen many familiar faces amongst the other guests. All celebrities from the world of business and politics.
115296	I hope we don't have to eat out of plastic bags as well. These natives simply don't understand culinary culture.
115302	I don't understand. The battery indicator said we could go another mile.
115306	There are a lot of cameras in this vehicle. Can I buy a video of this later on?
115307	There's always a risk involved in such trips. I'm just glad I don't need to listen to people telling me their life story anymore.
112956	Wow, what can I say...
112957	Very pleasing to hear.
112958	Kudos!
112959	That exceeded my boldest assumptions.
112960	Good!
112961	Outstanding!
112962	Bravo!
112963	My recommendations!
112974	Very well done!
112975	Superb!
112976	This is the outcome I was hoping for.
112977	A change like this was long overdue.
112978	At last.
112979	You never fail to impress me!
112980	Here's to you!
112981	A toast to your success!
112982	Allow me to congratulate you.
112983	My compliments to you.
112984	Don't be modest!
112985	You have not disappointed me.
112986	You brightened my day.
112987	I like your style of leadership!
112988	Well, you do live up to your reputation.
112989	What next!
112990	What a pity.
112991	I'd rather not think about the consequences.
112992	Outrageous!
112993	Unacceptable!
112994	A catastrophe!
112995	I suppose I celebrated too soon.
112996	So much for my good mood.
112997	Oh, please...
112998	All I can do is shake my head.
112999	And I always believed in you...
113000	Excuse me, but are you out of your mind?
113001	At least you tried.
113002	I'm sure you meant well.
113003	That was a complete flop, you know.
113004	How dare you!
113005	I could find words to make you feel better, but I won't...
113006	Don't even try to justify your performance.
113007	Go ahead, explain yourself!
113008	And I thought you were more of a winner.
113009	Please, be my guest.
113010	Now that is a familiar face...
113011	Do we know each oth... oh, yes, it's you, of course.
113012	I'm sure it's important...
113013	The pleasure is all mine.
113014	I would have sent for you anyhow.
113015	Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
113016	It's no bother. I enjoy playing host.
113017	Of course, stay as long as you like.
113018	Well, I can spare some time. What do you need?
113072	Very well, then.
113073	I've made up my mind. Yes.
113074	I'll see what I can do.
113075	Well, I wouldn't want to disappoint you, so sure...
113076	I have the means, so why shouldn't I?
113077	You have my full support.
113078	But just this once, you hear me.
113079	As long as you don't expect me to delight in it.
113080	Well, if you ask so blatantly.
113081	You're welcome.
113082	The very idea!
113083	Absolutely not!
113084	That is beyond my power.
113085	I have to firmly reject this.
113086	I don't promote things like this.
113087	You cannot demand such a thing.
113088	You cannot possibly be serious!
113089	Don't expect me to support you in this matter.
113090	Sorry. You can't always get what you want.
113091	I like your sense of humor... oh, you're serious...
113092	The whole world is watching this matter unfold. We should seize the opportunity.
113093	Now you can show your true worth.
113094	Can I entrust you with something this important?
113095	I would be more comfortable if I knew the matter was in good hands.
113096	This has the highest priority.
113097	Please, take care of the details.
113098	What you accomplished here was most admirable.
113099	I see you can be relied upon!
113100	Apparently, my confidence in you was justified.
113101	I assure you of my gratitude.
113102	You have surpassed even yourself.
113103	You have a way of solving problems that I find very refreshing!
113104	You have accomplished all there is to accomplish!
113105	Your diligence deserves respect.
113106	[Sigh] So much misguided potential!
113107	You should ask yourself why...
113108	Well, curiosity kills the company, or something like that.
113109	I already pumped money in to this project!
113110	It's back and forth with you.
113111	I demand an explanation.
113112	Thank you for keeping me informed. Is there anything new?
113113	I am certain you are making every effort to find a solution.
113114	I have other appointments, so are we done? Or are you, for that matter?
113115	Finish what you start. You are familiar with that saying, I hope?
113116	Here again? I don't know if I should feel flattered or let down.
113117	You take the matter seriously, I hope.
113118	I can see progress... Slow, but it is progress.
113119	Give me an estimate. How much longer will this take you?
113120	This is it, most certainly.
113121	Yes.
113122	Good. You found it.
113123	Impossible to overlook, isn't it?
113124	Well, seek and ye shall find.
113125	Please, be very careful with it.
113126	You have a good eye for such things.
113127	Well, you have this for a start.
113128	Did you invest in a modern navigation system?
113129	This is your destination, yes.
113130	Your destination.
113131	That is where I expect you to go.
113132	I hope you reach it in time.
113133	Please, set out immediately.
113134	It won't take you long, I hope.
113135	What are you waiting for?
113136	You're not to be overlooked, are you?
113137	Very sneaky, oh yes...
113138	Oh no, they've detected you.
113139	From here, it is only a short distance.
113140	Hurry. You almost have it.
113141	You have come to this point. Now go on.
113142	This far and no further.
113143	I must say, you are something of a treasure hunter.
113144	Very good. You found it at least.
113145	Outstanding. Now, if you could turn your attention to this...
113146	Bravo! But the matter is not yet completely resolved.
113147	Ahead of schedule. You should have enough time for this as well, then.
113148	I demand that you show no mercy!
113149	All talks have failed. Still, actions speak louder than words.
113150	Take the appropriate measures, however dire they may be.
113151	This threatens more than just our profits, if you get my drift.
113152	Someone must put a stop to this warmongering!
113153	Your will to prevail certainly deserves praise!
113154	Formidable. In every sense of the word.
113155	So much dedication!
113156	The loss of lives. How sad.
113157	Could you refrain from such... fatal adventures in the future?
113158	I've prepared letters of condolence.
113159	You are responsible for this!
113160	Seriously? This is what I invested in?
113161	Not to put too fine a point on it... horrible.
113162	Leave me alone! Or is privacy a scarcity as well?
113163	Not another word about my living conditions!
113165	I've been in golf clubs that are more livable.
113166	A booming city. I can hear crashing and exploding all around me!
113167	This place is... unacceptable.
113168	This life, it... it stretches me to the limit.
113170	You know, there is nothing overly positive to say...
113177	Don't tell me you consider yourself truly satisfied with this.
113164	A little savoir vivre! Is that asking too much?
113172	Well, I am used to more amenities.
113169	Not the center of the world, but I don't demand that, either.
113171	There are no capital problems, if that is what you are alluding to.
113173	A little... boring here, don't you think?
113174	Ordinary.
113175	Living here has some merit. Some.
113176	Well, I haven't complained, have I?
113178	Presentable, at least.
113179	So, my investments did pay off.
113180	Am I smiling? Of course!
113181	It is a good life here, certainly.
113182	Well, your city leaves little to be desired.
113183	Just you wait. In a few years, this might be the place to be.
113184	Oh, I like investing in your city. I can see how it benefits everyone.
113185	I have apartments in many cities around the globe. But why leave?
113186	Decay of urban culture? I see nothing of that sort around here.
113187	I am hard to please, so you should feel proud.
113188	You're on the right path, I can say that much.
113189	I saw the greatest of all cities... well, actually I'm looking at it right now.
113190	I may be dressed for success, but you seem to be made for it!
113191	I know a rainmaker when I see one. When you're around, I always carry an umbrella.
