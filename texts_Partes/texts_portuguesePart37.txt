116268	Here comes a depression. So better resurrect your anoraks, folks. Some chilly winds blowing in from the Arctic Circle. Climate stabilizers, what would you do without them...
116269	Thanks, Lloyd. For those who have just tuned in, I'm Lauren Beringer and this is "Global Warning" filling you in on what moves the world in 2205.
116270	However, we're reaching out into orbit today. Live from the Moon we're linked to Virgil Drake, Executive Overseer of Mining for the Lunar Excavation Corp. Good morning, Mr. Drake.
116271	Mr. Drake, as a member of the LEC, you live on the Moon 24/7. How do you view the relationship between Earth and the Moon a good century after the establishment of the first moon colony?
116272	Hard words, coming from a member of a government-owned organization...
116273	Mr. Drake, pardon me, but isn't it always easy to blame the government? The Global Union has to balance manifold interests. Take the Arctic Custodians. Their Climate Stabilizers preserve what's left of the polar regions...
116274	Actually, the Global Union is now starting the Lunar Licensing Program, awarding Moon parcels to private corporations.
116275	Indeed, the Big Five are at forefront of the Lunar Licensing Program. But don't you fear the LEC will fade into insignificance with competition like that?
116276	Our time is up. Thank you for the interview, Mr. Drake.
116277	Yes, the Lunar Licensing Program is currently the hottest topic around. We now go to our correspondent at Global Union headquarters.

13000501	I'm not the only one of my kind. Every Ark has its own EVE. But my sisters and I are not linked. I think I sometimes --- feel --- loneliness.
