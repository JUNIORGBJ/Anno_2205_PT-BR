10000042	Be grateful, I'm leaving you the fruits of multiple lifetimes of work. That's why the location's undocumented, don't want the nosey buggers finding it.
10000043	You know where to look, right? Underwater warehouses are for the ages, they said! Or maybe y'all are underwater yourselves now?
10000044	So how's the future? Still fighting them tsunamis and high tide? Not expecting an answer, just let an old man wax philosophical. But you better build something that lasts.
10000045	Underwater earthquakes are only getting worse. Had to abandon my own treasures. Not safe, they said! Well now at least there's you to take care of them.
10000046	...this thing recording? Right! You're back! Thought I had just one? Not when there are whole cities down there! So, you got something shiny, and I want my Lady safe.
10000047	You're listening to this log that means... I'm not around to take care of my ship. You ain't getting a peep on the second stash until I'm sure she's fine! Incentive, ya see?
10000048	Salt water can do something fierce to a nuclear generator, and it never was all that stable. But she's fine, isn't she? A year or three wouldn't harm her!
10000049	Alright, whatever you just did caused a power surge. How's that for clairvoyance? Just kidding. Alright, I'm convinced, the location-... is-... got it? ...
10000050	... Alright, I'm convinced, the location is south of here, got it? My ship's a vessel for the ages, whatever hiccups you've fixed, they're not gonna bring her down. You there yet?
10000051	The sea's been rumbling again, but they said not to worry. I bet they're causing this! Holing up at the bottom of the Ebashi trench like sardines in a tin is messing with their heads!
10000052	That's it, that's my treasure! Not much use to me anymore... I can't reach it, the hatches caved in. That'll happen to those Tech weirdos too, sooner or later.
10000054	I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me! Alright, I got one more. Didn't wanna give this one up, but you gotta do me one more favor in return.
10000055	This one's a bit tricky, so listen up. People these days have the attention span of ants. It's 2085 and we're still stuck on earth! If I was... Right, right, where was I? Ah, the storage.
10000056	Locks are the parts that rust first, so just in case, there's a failsafe. Nice of me to record it, right? It's split in three parts, so you don't flood the whole thing by accident.
10000057	Computer says you got them modules. Not sure about the power supply these days, but those Techs told me it'll last a good century! Don't trust them as far as I can throw'em, though.
10000058	See, all fine and dandy. There are some neat defense mechanisms, too. Be sure to get the module order right! I had to duck for cover a few times before...
10000059	Those defense subs scorched the hull a few times, too. But I always reset it in the nick of time. Oh the irony if my own security sank my ship one day!
10000060	Doors still locked? Well listen up. One day the Lady's gonna run outta fuel. And I want to keep her going till the sodding end of the world. So you refuel her... and I'll give you the key.
10000061	There you go, my haul is yours. It's not like I'll need it where I'm headed... or am now, I s'pose. But my Lady, she's gonna be around long after I'm gone.

10000151	Hi! Trenchcoat's my name. Figured out a plan... Maybe not all on the up and up, this thing... But it's worth it. Want in?
10000152	I remember you... Picked up a whole bunch o' interesting stuff. I can put your coordinates back onto my route.
10000153	Take a look at this... In your place I wouldn't pass up the opportunity. Sooner or later we all gotta bite the grass, right?

7001818	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] worries about the mutated virus and will contact you soon.
7001819	[NOTIFICATION_CHARACTER_NAME] advises you to install the newest module.
7000332	"Setting up a research division comes before anything else, though. We've got to be prepared for anything."
7000331	"Here's the catch: a virus has broken out of the vault. For a research team to match it, we're dependent on your supply network, your spaceport."
7000334	"Even though the marshes are the most biodiverse habitat here, we have no choice but to drain them. We can't work with the little space we have."
7000333	"Not just any staff will do. The research division needs experts to combat the virus."
7001456	"The team has extracted the first samples, but no trace of the virus so far. I want to run more tests, but we're understaffed."
7000335	"The moss sample is virus-free and surprisingly versatile. I've engineered an agriculture module with it, so go ahead and see for yourself how important our work is."
7000218	"We can't do anything with frozen seeds, but thawing them isn't so easy. A fixed temperature control can do that without risking a viral outbreak."
7000219	"Think of what we're building as a kind of climate stabilizer. I've got the blueprints of the real deal as reference and now we need the staff to realize them."
7000220	"For the temperature control to work, you'll need to clear its ventilation shafts. The Eden Initiative never imagined the volcano would bury them one day."
7000221	"Okay, so the old temperature modules are a complete loss. Time to replace them."
7000222	"And now comes the heavy-lifting on the shoulders of nature. This structure needs quite a lot of fuel to run."
7000223	"All clear. I'm just waiting for you to flip the lever now."
7000224	"As if closing off the sector would make the blown up reactor disappear. Now it is up to us to clear out the radioactive wreckage."
7000225	"The reactor didn't stand a chance against the volcano. Making it safer will start with a new cooling system."
7000226	"Alright, we've got all major wreckage parts and mapped out the rest. Now it's just a matter of shipping them off."
7000227	"With that out of the way our team can get to work on the reactor. They need to get there, though."
7000228	"Don't worry, we're just using the generator to get into the vault. And for that it needs quite a lot of input to start up."
7000229	"The sooner we finish up with the generator the faster we can get back to the virus. Switch it on, now."
7000232	"I've got news and it's not good: Sprawl Fever is back from extinction. Can you get me live samples? Infected musk oxen have been sighted at the fringes of the valley."
7000230	"Worst case just came true. Researchers just reported symptoms while taking water samples from the lakes. Recovering them is our top priority."
7000231	"The vaccine isn't ready yet and the patients' vitals are failing. Quick, get them something to boost their immune system."
7000233	"Our patients are stable and Howard has proposed a joint research endeavor. The Custodian labs can help us as soon as they get the seed samples."
7000234	"Whatever the Custodian virologists are doing, it's too slow. We've got to support them from here."
7000235	"Volcano erupted, damaged the reactor, reactor damaged the vault, vault exposed the infected seeds. And now here we are and need to seal the leaks."
7000236	"This still leaves us with mosquitoes, the primary disease-spreaders. Draining the marshes in the valley will decimate their numbers."
7000237	"Finally, I've got a vaccine at the ready. I'll have it distributed amongst the staff, but the animals in the wild need individual treatment."
7000238	"With our patients treated and disease vectors taken care of, we still have all those seed containers that need checking. Would you delegate a team?"
7000239	"The team has identified the infected seeds. Custodian regulations require us to scrub down the vault and I've got just the right antidote."

7001129	You're not just going to stand around, are you?
7001130	Good news, bad news, I'm prepared either way.
7001136	Gotcha!
7001137	Yes, alright.
7001138	I got this.
7001146	No chance!
7001147	Absolutely not.
7001148	Nope, not an option right now.
7001162	This job isn't out of your skill range, is it?
7001163	You're one of the few I can trust to get this job done.
7001164	I'm swamped with work. Can you take this assignment?
7001168	Glad you took it seriously.
7001169	Perfect, now I can take it from here.
7001170	Great job! I wouldn't know why Howard has a problem with you.
7001171	Now that's what I call a job well done.
